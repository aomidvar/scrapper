anti-virus detections in virustotal (see example in figure 1), though our internal threat analysis systems have flagged them as malicious. \\xa0upon inspection of the samples, alien labs has identified them as modifications of the open-source prism backdoor used by multiple threat actors in various campaigns.we have conducted further investigation of the samples and discovered that several campaigns using these malicious executables have managed to remain active and under the radar for more than 3.5 years. the oldest samples alien labs can attribute to one of the actors date from the 8th of november, 2017.figure 1. prism sample marked as clean in virustotal, as captured by alien labs.waterdropthe waterdrop variant is easily identifiable as it includes a function named xencrypt which performs xor encryption with the hard-coded single-byte 0x1f key. starting in version 7 of the waterdrop variant, samples include the plain-text string “waterdropx vx started”, where x is the integer version number. so far, we have observed versions 1, 2.2, and 3 still using the name prism. versions 7, 9, and 12 are named waterdropx.it also uses the easily identifiable user agent string “agent-waterdropx” for the http-based command and control (c&c) communications, and it reaches to subdomains of the waterdropx[.]com domain.while all these may seem to be fairly obvious indicators, the threat actor behind this variant has managed to maintain a zero or almost-zero detection score in virustotal for its samples and domains. this is most likely due to their campaigns being fairly small in size. the waterdropx[.]com domain was registered to the current owner on august 18, 2017, and as of august 10, 2021, it was still online.besides the base prism features, waterdrop introduces xor encryption for the configuration and an additional process that regularly queries the c&c for commands to execute (see figure 2).figure 2. function to query c&c for commandsthis communication with the c&c server is plain-text http, and it is performed via the curl command. in all the versions alien labs has observed, the option -a “agent-waterdropx” is used, meaning the user agent header will remain constant across versions.we have also observed some samples of this variant that load a kernel module if the process is executed with root privileges (see figure 3).figure 3. installing the waterdrop.ko kernel moduleprism v1alien labs has found samples tagged as “prism v1” that we can attribute to the same threat actor with high confidence as they use the same c&c domain (waterdropx[.]com). the samples also share distinctive features such as the agent-waterdropx user agent string.compared to the public prism, this version introduces the creation of a child process that constantly queries the c&c server for commands to execute. the initial request to the c&c server is performed by the following command:prism v1 does not feature any kind of obfuscation, packing, or encryption of the binaries.prism v2.2prism\\xa0 v2.2 introduces the usage of xor encryption to obfuscate sensitive data, such as the bash command strings used. the key is a single byte, and it is hard coded to the 0x1f value. this particular key is used across all the samples from this threat actor we observed.for this version, the initial c&c uri request format is:prism v3prism v3 is identical to v2.2, with one exception: clients include a bot id for identification purposes. this bot id is saved to /etc/.xid and used in the malware beacon (see figure 4).figure 4. usage of bot idthe initial request format is:waterdrop v7waterdrop v7 introduces the use of a kernel module that is installed using insmod if the process has root privileges. the code responsible for this task can be seen in figure 3. we have not yet been able to retrieve the kernel module for analysis. therefore, we are not able to determine the purpose of this payload.the rest of the code is identical to prism v3, only changing the hard-coded version value.as such, the initial request format is:waterdrop v9continuing the trend of previous versions, the changes on waterdrop v9 are minimal. the only change found in this version is that instead of using a hard-coded icmp password, the bot uses its own bot id as icmp password to spawn reverse shells.the initial request format is:waterdrop v12waterdrop v12 is almost identical to its predecessors, with an enhancement to the backdoor stability. as such, the initial request format is:alien labs began its research investigating the z0gg[.]me domain. said domain resolves to an ip address that is shared by another twelve domains (see figure 5).figure 5. domain overlaps for target addresssome of the overlapping domains are known prism c&c domains, however, z0gg[.]me is contacted by several samples\\xa0that also reach out to github.com. particularly, samples were observed contacting the “https://github.com/lirongchun/i” repository.in this repository we can observe the following files.as the actor is using a public git repository to host its malware and infrastructure information, we can obtain the historical data and see its evolution.for example, we can gather all the ip addresses that the actor has used as c&c servers with the following command:grouping them by size we observed two different clusters: 1) one containing samples that are around 15k and 2) ones that are around 1.1mb. after a quick triage, we assessed that the light-weight binaries are standard prism backdoors, while the bigger sized binaries belong to another malware family. given the git’s history, we were able to observe how the actor started using the prism backdoor for their operative, and then on july 16, 2019, switched to the custom implant in commit 6055e31cc87679a7198e1143d1eddcdfc9313816. it is also notable that this custom implant’s binaries are packed using a modified version of upx.the following binary analysis of said custom implants uses sample with sha256 aaeee0e6f7623f0087144e6e318441352fef4000e7a8dd84b74907742c244ff5 as a reference.figure 6. detection evolution for analyzed samplethe binaries from this particular malware family are quite large in size (1-3 mb compared to the ~15kb of the typical prism binary). this is due to the binaries having libcurl statically compiled into them, which is evident due to the presence of known libcurl strings. we have named this malware family “prismaticsuccessor.”by decompiling the main function, alien labs observed that the binary takes an optional parameter. if said parameter is the character “9,” it prints the configuration. for these binaries, the configuration consists of two urls: 1) hosturl is used to fetch the c&c host and 2) porturl is used to fetch the port number to contact the previous host on.we have also observed that immediately after these actions, the malware attempts to open and lock /var/lock/sshd.lock. if it fails to do so, it fakes a segmentation fault. this procedure ensures that the malware is not already running in the machine (see figure 7).figure 7. configuration and lock checknext, the malware decrypts a string containing a process name, which is used to overwrite “argv”. this technique avoids using prctl. the possible command line arguments are also smashed and replaced by the whitespace character (see figure 8).figure 8. argv smashingnote that the amcwfkvf variable contains the “[mcwfkvf]” value, which is decrypted to “[kauditd]” in “src.” the decryption routine is rot13 with -2 as key. this particular rot13 only rotates lower- and upper-case letters, not symbols or numbers (see figure 9).figure 9. rot13 implementationthe above actions conclude the environment setup process for the malware. next, the malicious activity begins, which includes spawning child processes, so the malware can multitask. this also makes it harder to trace the malware (see figure 10).figure 10. malicious activity loopspawning child processes:the first fork terminates the parent and only lets the child continue – the first-order child.first-order child. this first-order child will fork again, spawning a second order child. the first order child will execute the “while” loop body endlessly, spawning three additional child processes (third-order childs). the second order child will contact the fallback c&c server.second-order child. the second-order child will open a reverse shell session to a fallback hard-coded c&c server. the sample ships with up to three c&c addresses, encrypted with rot13. these addresses attempt to resolve via gethostbyname. the first one that resolves successfully is contacted on tcp port 80. for this particular sample, the secondary c&c address list is “z0gg.me”, “x63.in” and “x47.in.” (see figure 11.)figure 11. rot13 encrypted c&c listthe server is also required to reply with a password in order for the reverse shell to be successfully established. however, the required password is not shipped in the binary. instead, the malware calculates the md5 hash of the replied buffer and compares it to the hard-coded value “ef4a85e8fcba5b1dc95adaa256c5b482”.this communication is performed whether the primary c&c server is successfully contacted or not. the primary c&c server does not include a password mechanism. (see figure 12.)_figure 12. secondary command and control server contactthe first of the third-order child processes gets the c&c host and port from github and opens a reverse shell to the ip:port indicated in those urls (see figure 13 and 14).figure 13. obtaining c&c host from githubfigure 14. obtaining c&c port from githubthe function to spawn a shell to a host is very similar to the one found in prism’s source code, if not identical (see figure 15 and 16).figure 15. spawning a shell session to c&cfigure 16. prism function to spawn the reverse shell sessionif it fails to spawn the shell, the child dies and the whole process will be reattempted in 15 seconds.the other two third-order child processes jump to shellcode routines. these routines are encrypted with a hard-coded 8-byte xor key and include a small self-decrypting stub (see figures 17 and 18).figure 17. first shellcode routineeach of these routines build a command in the stack and launch it. for the analyzed sample the commands were /bin/sh -c sed -i \"/\\\\\\\\(z0gg.me\\\\\\\\|x63.in\\\\\\\\)/d\" /etc/hosts and /bin/sh -c \"grep -q \\'nameserver 8.8.8.8\\' /etc/resolv.conf||echo \\'nameserver 8.8.8.8\\' >> /etc/resolv.conf\". (see figure 18.)figure 18. emulated stack with example command stringwhen alien labs searched for the obtained command lines, we got an interesting result in stackoverflow\\xa0where a user complains about a suspicious process in their machine. this indicates that the threat is being used in the wild.we have observed other actors using the prism backdoor for their operations. however, in the majority of these cases, the actor(s) use the original prism backdoor as is, without performing any major modifications. this fact, combined with the open-source nature of the backdoor, impedes us from properly tracking the actor(s) activity.prism is an open-source simplistic and straightforward backdoor. its traffic is clearly identifiable and its binaries are easy to detect. despite this, prism’s binaries have been undetected until now, and its c&c server has remained online for more than 3.5 years. this shows that while bigger campaigns that receive more attention are usually detected within hours, smaller ones can slip through.alien labs expects the adversaries to remain active and conduct operations with this toolset and infrastructure. we will continue to monitor and report any noteworthy findings.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.suricata ids signatures\\xa0osquery queries\\xa0yara rules\\xa0the following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence. a list of indicators is also available in the otx pulse. please note, the pulse may include other activities related but out of the scope of the report.typeindicatordescription\\xa0the findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: malware, malware research, alienvault labs, prisminsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",

(t1119)figure 14. parsing c&c command.some of the commands fatalrat supports are shown below.spreading itself on the victim network by brute-forcing weak passwords through ipc$. if successful, the malware copies itself to the dedicated folder as %folder%\\\\hackshen.exe and will execute the copied file remotely. see figures 15-17.figure 15. weak user and password for brute force.figure 16. brute force loop.figure 17. copy and execute remote computer on successful brute-force attack.either steal stored data (for chrome for example) or delete saved information with a handler for different browsers. see figure 18.figure 18. malware handlers for different browser.fatalrat also includes additional commands, for the following:figure 19. more available commands.the newly identified fatalrat malware has been using techniques like obfuscation, anti-sandbox and antivirus evasion, encrypted configurations, logging user keystrokes, system persistence, login brute force, collection of system data, and encrypted communications with command and control server. alien labs has discovered multiple samples in the past few months, with a slight dip in july. however, we expect to continue to see the presence of fatalrat and its variants in our samples in the near future. at&t alien labs will continue to monitor this threat and update intelligence as activity emerges.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.suricata ids signatures\\xa0yara rules\\xa0the following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence. a list of indicators is also available in the otx pulse. please note, the pulse may include other activities related but out of the scope of the report.typeindicatordescriptionsha256e52af19dce25d51f9cf258613988b8edc583f7c7e134d3e1b834d9aab9c7c4c4malware hashsha256dc026cd76891d1f84f44f6789ac0145a458e2c704a7bc50590ec08966578edb3malware hashsha256cb450f82c49eadd597a87645f9f30c52c03c6ed9425386af5b321664fe3a6da0malware hashsha256210990e36122e0facc7c74373569f052fa0651ab06644330fe00b685793ee0fdmalware hashsha25634f37327a0154d644854a723e0557c733931e2366a19bdb4cfe6f6ae6770c50fmalware hashsha256ec0dcfe2d8380a4bafadb3ed73b546cbf73ef78f893e32202042a5818b67ce56malware hashsha256b01719e59675236df1a0e1a78cdd97455c0cf18426c7ec0f52df1f3a78209f65malware hashsha25672cd668d9bc442f522556807390d4f7e32966bef20ef1a831bf36a5ab213191emalware hashsha2561cabdb7ab1cbd0526498d15839c780850a41a8c917b65581fad9e7dbdedd5e0fmalware hashsha2565453911d6f597d65ab542ec25723a7d87b2292c2e2a52a40d3a32032f6117acdmalware hashsha256826d07108a1223140e6a58b44722404009ac2e82df0acfd7d1f5bf29b56526b6malware hashsha256337841b5ade52ba853a30eb8ab04dede64d89808893fb6e04122479502951528malware hashsha25617075832426b085743c2ba811690b525cf8d486da127edc030f28bb3e10e0734malware haship address103.119.44[.]152c&cip address103.119.44[.]93c&cip address103.119.44[.]100c&c\\xa0the findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:\\xa0tags: malware, yara, alien labs, otx pulse, otx, brute force attack, remote access trojan, weak passwords, fatalratinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.\"}\n",
            "{'titel': 'lazarus campaign ttps and evolution', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs™ has observed new activity that has been attributed to the lazarus adversary group potentially targeting engineering job candidates and/or employees in classified engineering roles within the u.s. and europe. this assessment is based on malicious documents believed to have been delivered by lazarus during the last few months (spring 2021). however, historical analysis shows the lures used in this campaign to be in line with others used to target these groups.the purpose of this blog is to share the new technical intelligence and provide detection options for defenders. alien labs will continue to report on any noteworthy changes.key takeaways:since 2009, the known tools and capabilities believed to have been used by the lazarus group include ddos botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (rats), and drive wiper malware. the most publicly documented malware and tools used by the group actors include destover, duuzer, and hangman.several documents identified from may to june 2021 by twitter users were identified as being linked to the lazarus group. documents observed in previous campaigns lured victims with job opportunities for boeing and bae systems. these new documents include:the documents attempted to impersonate new defense contractors and engineering companies like airbus, general motors (gm), and rheinmetall. all of these documents contain macro malware, which has been developed and improved during the course of this campaign and from one target to another. the core techniques for the three malicious documents are the same, but the attackers attempted to reduce the potential detections and increase the faculties of the macros.the first two documents from early may 2021 were related to a german engineering company focused on the defense and automotive industries, rheinmetall. the second malicious document appears to include more elaborate content, which may have resulted in the documents going unnoticed by victims.the macro has base64 encoded files, which are extracted and decoded during execution. some of the files are split inside the macro and are not combined until the time of decoding. one of the most distinctive characteristics of this macro is how it evades detections of a mz header encoded in base64 (tvoa, tvpb, tvpq, tvqa, tvqq or tvro), by separating the first two characters from the rest of the content, as seen in figure 1.figure 1: concealing of mz header, as captured by alien labs.the rest of the content is kept together in lines of 64 characters, and because of this, yara rules can be used to detect other, typical executable content encoded in base64 aside of the mz header. in this case, up to nine different yara rules alerted to suspicious encoded strings in our alien labs analysis, like virtualprotect, getprocaddress, isdebuggerpresent, getcurrentprocessid, etc.figure 2: yara rules detections listed in the at&t alien labs open threat exchange, otx.all files created by the executable and used by the different macros are located in a new folder c:/drivers with the purpose of masquerading their activity. the macro copies and renames the microsoft legitimate executable certutil.exe into this folder. the reason for this copy is to avoid endpoint detection and response (edr) signatures based on system utilities executed from non-standard sources (a microsoft office document in this case). additionally, the copy of certutil is disguised to avoid using the full string, by partially replacing it with an asterisk %systemroot%\\\\system32\\\\certut*.exe. as seen in later iterations, this technique was slightly modified to further reduce the number of detections.certutil is used to decode the previously mentioned file, doing it within the same folder and with a different executable name. once the necessary files have been decoded, the encoded files are removed from the system.the script queries wmi to list all the explorer.exe processes, where it will try to inject the malicious payload. for the injection, the attackers used mavinject (a legitimate windows component that can be used and abused) to perform arbitrary code injections inside any running process. mavinject.exe has been abused for several years, as indicated in this blog from 2017.figure 3: mavinject injection to explorer, as captured by alien labs.figure 4: malicious document execution tree listed in the at&t alien labs otx.the payload is in fact a downloader, which requests the next stage to a hardcoded command and control (c&c) server and saves it to a new file. this request is made through https with hardcoded headers. in this case, the domain used as c&c has been registered for several years, and the domain continues to have a long expiration date. for these reasons, this domain was assessed as a compromised domain, leveraged by lazarus as c&c.figure 5: hardcoded http headers, as captured by alien labs.a few weeks after the rheinmetall document was observed, a very similar document emerged targeting general motors. the characteristics of this document were very similar to the previous one, but with minor updates in the c&c communication process.after attempting to execute all its code, the macro reports back to the c&c server with the status of the infection. in the code, a variable is updated from 1 to 3, signaling the status of the execution. the c&c is capable of tracking where its execution is failing, or encountering unexpected behavior, based on the requests made to the different documents in the c&c. this includes:the status report to the c&c also requests the lure document, which at this moment is downloaded from the same c&c and opened.figure 6: c&c beacon to report execution status, as captured by alien labs.the domain used in this document and payload allgraphicart[.]com is no longer a compromised domain. it was first registered on april 1, 2021. however, it did not have any noteworthy activity until these malicious documents showed up, at least a month after the domain was registered. the domain was registered with porkbun llc, who offers domains with the free option of protecting the whois information.in early june, a month after the first document of this campaign was observed, a new document was identified targeting airbus. this time, the c&c communications were very similar to the previous iteration of the document; however, the execution and injection processes were different.this document continues utilizing and masquerading certutil, but the copy command had the minor addition of another asterisk to reduce the detection risk: %systemroot%\\\\system32\\\\*ertut*.exe. in addition to certutil, the legitimate explorer executable is copied to the c:\\\\drivers folder through a similar method %systemroot%\\\\exp*.exe. as previously mentioned, these files will be copied and renamed to avoid edr signature-based detections, but this time the destination filenames were carefully chosen. if alphabetically ordered, the first two files will correspond to legitimate software, followed by the malicious files, which could mislead investigators on their first peak on the c:\\\\drivers folder.this macro contains three files encoded with base64 which are copied to disk and decoded during execution:after the actions, the macro executes the mentioned payload with an updated technique. the attackers are no longer using mavinject, but directly executing the payload with explorer.exe, significantly modifying the resulting execution tree as seen in figure 10. once the payload has been executed, the macro waits for three seconds before creating of an .inf file in the same folder. whether it was successfully executed or not, the macro will proceed to send the beacon to the c&c with the execution status and delete all the temporary files, attempting to clean their tracks. the only files left in c:\\\\drivers\\\\ at this point are the payload and the .inf file.figure 7: malicious document execution tree, as captured by at&t alien labs.the new c&c shopweblive[.]com follows the same pattern and characteristics of the one used in the second iteration.the reported activity remains in line with the lazarus’ past campaigns and is not expected to be the last. attack lures, potentially targeting engineering professionals in government organizations, showcase the importance of tracking lazarus and their evolution. we continue to see lazarus using the same tactic, techniques, and procedures that we have observed in the past, such as using microsoft office documents that download remote templates, microsoft office macros, and compromised third party infrastructure to host the payloads and proxy c&c traffic through. at&t alien labs will continue to monitor and report on any noteworthy changes.the following associated detection methods are in use

(by default, the malware will encrypt the current directory and its subfolders.)during execution, the malware will first check if its configuration exists. the configuration file format is very similar to the one observed for revil windows samples, but with fewer fields. some of the fields presented in both versions include:figure 2: hard-coded config file, as captured by alien labs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0figure 3: hard-coded ransom note after decoding, as captured by alien labs.the malware will loop through the target folder, encrypting the files in it. before encryption, it will check to see if the file has already been encrypted by looking at the filename extension.during encryption, the malware will generate a 64 bytes xor key, based on the pk key given in the config file. it will use this key during the encryption process. after encryption, the malware will write the generated key “iv” at the end of each file and leave a ransom note in each folder.figure 4: main encryption routine, as captured by alien labs.figure 5: main encryption routine, as captured by alien labs.the malware will log all the files it goes through, stating if the file was encrypted or if it was unable to encrypt due to os protection.figure 6: encryption logs, as captured by alien labs.figure 7: execution output, as captured by alien labs. .the threat actors behind revil raas have rapidly developed a linux version to compete against the recently released linux version of darkside. it is hard to clarify if these two raas are competing against each other or collaborating team members, as stated by other security researchers. nevertheless, both actors have been very active in the ransomware landscape during the last months, and these upgrades will keep them in the spotlight due to the increased attacking spectrum.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence. a list of indicators is also available in the otx pulse. please note, the pulse may include other activities related but out of the scope of the report.\\xa0typeindicatordescriptionsha256ea1872b2835128e3cb49a0bc27e4727ca33c4e6eba1e80422db19b505f965bc4revil linux samplesha256d6762eff16452434ac1acc127f082906cc1ae5b0ff026d0d4fe725711db47763revil linux samplesha256796800face046765bd79f267c56a6c93ee2800b76d7f38ad96e5acb92599fcd4revil linux samplesha2563d375d0ead2b63168de86ca2649360d9dcff75b3e0ffa2cf1e50816ec92b3b7drevil linux samplethe findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: malware, alien labs, otx pulse, ransomware, security, linux, labs, raas, revilinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",
            "{'titel': 'darkside raas in linux version', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs recently analyzed the linux version of the darkside ransomware, one of the most active ransomware in the last quarter. shortly after hitting colonial pipeline, darkside developers announced they would be closing operations.linux and unix servers have always been a preferred option for servers and data centers, likely due to the small attack surface of the servers, tight configurations, and lack of user interaction. however, they are often set up and then forgotten, left without detection or protection mechanisms. this makes them very attractive to attackers. by infecting unprotected virtualization servers, attackers can perform devastating attacks on companies, taking down all the services of a company with a single infection.first discovered in august 2020, darkside is a group that operates ransomware as a service (raas), and attacks by their network of affiliates have infected many companies worldwide. the most high profile infection happened when a darkside affiliate hit the network of one of the major oil pipeline companies\\xa0in the us, colonial pipeline, causing the company to shut down operations for days. after this attack — likely due to the fact that it drew unwanted levels of attention to the group globally — the malware authors announced publicly the closure of their service. nevertheless, there is evidence that the group has completed a linux version of its malware that is targeting esxi, servers hosting vmware virtual machines. to this point, the authors announced the darkside 2.0 version with linux capabilities on march 9, 2021 in the xss forum:figure 1. example of linux version features and information announced by malware authors on xss forum. \\xa0unlike the windows version of the malware that targets any windows endpoint, darkside linux version is mostly targeting esxi servers. its default configuration includes the root path of esx server machines. \\xa0targeted extensions are 'vmdk', 'log', 'vmem', 'vmsn' that are used in esx servers for saving virtual machines information, data, and logs.the malware is quite informative and prints to the screen most of the actions it performs, which is an uncommon behavior for malware. this could imply that the malware is being deployed manually. the malware is written in c++ and it’s also using several open-source libraries that were imported and compiled with the malware code into one binary. some of these libraries are: crypto++\\xa0used for encryption, boost\\xa0used for logging purposes, and curl\\xa0used for http requests. the use of these libraries enables the final binary to be a 2.7mb file size. for example, to communicate with an infected machine with its command and control (c&c), the malware uses libcurl functions that were compiled with the rest of the code.in addition, the malware supports command line parameters during execution to replace almost, if not all, of the default configuration variables.figure 2. parameters supported by the malware.the malware also supports shutting down virtual machines by executing the esxcli commands, a special console on esx servers that allows it to interact with virtual machines from the command line.figure 3. abusing esxcli command.when executed, the malware prints its configuration to the terminal. this includes the root path to encrypt, rsa key information, targeted file extensions to encrypt, c2 addresses, and more, as seen in figure 4.figure 4. darkside configuration.the c&c addresses are encrypted using a rotated xor key, which will be decrypted when the malware is executed. the decrypted addresses can be found in appendix a:figure 5. decryption loop to extract c&c.figure 6. malware xor key.the malware will then count the files to be encrypted, and it collects information from the infected machine, sending it to the c&c server after encryption. the exfiltrated information includes: user name, os version, hostname, build, and more:figure 7. collecting system information.figure 8 shows an example of the information collected from an infected machine.figure 8. example of collected system information.the malware will loop through the files to be encrypted and then encrypt them using chacha20 with the rsa 4096 key taken from the configuration. after encryption, the malware will add a tail at the end of the encrypted file that includes a constant and the cipher, as seen in figure 9.figure 9. adding header after successful

especially when it comes to virtual machine servers that may contain multiple machines that are primary targets for darkside malware.darkside will search files on the main folder of the infected

            "{'titel': 'malware hosting domain cyberium fanning out mirai variants', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs has observed the mirai variant botnet, known as moobot, scanning for known but uncommon vulnerabilities in tenda routers, resulting in a considerable peak in our internal telemetry. the research associated with this peak resulted in the discovery of a malware hosting domain, providing several different mirai variants, like moobot and satori.key points:during the end of march, at&t alien labs observed a spike in exploitation attempts for tenda remote code execution (rce) vulnerability cve-2020-10987. this spike was observed throughout a significant number of clients, in the space of a few hours. this vulnerability is not commonly used by web scanners and was barely detected by our honeypots during the last six months, except for a minor peak in november.this exploit can be identified by the url that is requested, which includes ‘setusbunload’ with the payload assigned to the vulnerable parameter ‘devicename’. this payload contains the logic to change the execution path to a temporary location, wget a file from a malware hosting page, provide execution permissions, and execute it.figure 1. binaryedge sensor detecting the vulnerability scan.following this thread, a single actor was identified to be behind these scans in late march — at the time, the actor appeared to have no previous activity. the scan for tenda vulnerable routers only lasted one day, but the scanning activity continued for several weeks, including the below vulnerabilities:some of these exploit attempts were captured by honeypots. all of them appeared to be pulling their next iteration of the malware from the same malware hosting page: dns.cyberium[.]cc.when this domain was investigated, several campaigns were identified, going back at least one year to may 2020. most of the attacks lasted for approximately a week while they hosted several mirai variants, after which they left the subdomain unresolvable. however, this seems to be the behavior of the threat actor in between operations. the actors appear to come back to the same domain with a new subdomain for each new campaign. activity in between campaigns goes quiet to increase the trust of the original domain. keeping a long-running existing domain while issuing brand new one domain helps to divert attention to the new domain and thus distract from the original.figure 2. riskiq heatmap of cyberium[.]cc.the full list of subdomains/campaigns identified from this domain is:we were able to identify other infrastructure that we assess with high confidence is controlled by the same actor and has been used as moobot command and control in the past.all of the domains use the same:the first request to these malware hosting pages was for a bash script, which aimed to download later stages of the malware. as seen in the screenshot below, the script attempts to download a list of filenames (associated with different cpu architectures), executes each one of them, achieves persistence through a crontab that redownloads the bash script itself, and finally deletes itself.figure 3. tenda downloader script.this script is very similar to downloaders previously seen for mirai variants. the minor modifications appear to be on the downloading server, persistence methods (if any) and the filename, usually named after the vulnerable device vendor.during the time this domain was available and delivering malware, at least three different variants of mirai were identified: moobot, satori/fbot, and other samples unassociated with these botnets. one of the peculiarities of this domain was how it juggled between mirai variants, even under the same filenames. the same url could be hosting satori one day and moobot the week after.in october 2020, lacework\\xa0reported on a new mirai variant called moobot. this variant mainly chased exposed and vulnerable dockers apis to include them into their ddos botnet. one of the main distinctions of this variant has been a hardcoded string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, compared to the mirai source code which used the string “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw012345678” as a seed to generate an alphanumeric string. this random string is used several times throughout the code, one of them to generate the process name to be used during execution.many samples available at cyberium contained the above-mentioned string and this domain was already being used to distribute this botnet when lacework first reported on it. however, the number of samples alien labs has seen with that string has greatly increased in the last months, scattering from the original moobot sample. this could potentially mean that last year\\'s moobots samples were used to create new branches of mirai variants.unlike some other mirai variants, the samples obtained from moobot were encrypted, attempting to evade string-based detection, static analysis of the exploits used, or after compromised activities. however, it did maintain other previously seen characteristics, like a hardcoded list of ip addresses\\xa0to avoid, such as: private ranges, the department of defense, iana ips, ge, hp and others.figure 4. moobot’s ip scan restrictions.the malware writers appear to be very aware of who they’re potential victims are. for this reason, the malware will try to hide its process name by changing it using prctl. the covert process name is “/var/sofia”, which is the name of a video application on the targeted devices.figure 5. moobot process hideout.right after hiding the process, this sample will print to screen the string “9xsspnvgc8aj5pi7m28p” which has been associated with different mirai variants over time (fbot\\xa0and gafgyt). however, it appears this is a passed down characteristic through variant versions, like previously seen with “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, but this time there aren’t any shared iocs with previous attackers.after successful infection, the payload attempts to query the hardcoded c2 on port 12028 to get a list of c2. at the time of study, the cyberium domain was down, and these communications couldn’t be analyzed.early in march 2021, the same links previously mentioned for moobot, for example dns.cyberium[.]cc/arm, were actually providing samples for satori. the satori botnet, also known as fbot, is yet another mirai variant based botnet. unexpectedly, these samples were mingled with other unix botnets in the same malware hosting server.the similarities between moobot and satori samples are vast, since they both are coming from the same mirai source code. these similarities include:the most noteworthy differences observed were:additional samples were identified under the same domain, which on a first investigation appeared to be a mix between the already mentioned moobot and satori samples with a random combination of their characteristics. most of them looked like moobot samples without the encoding or satori without the hardcoded domain.however, the samples are not associated with the current domain under study, probably because it is being left fallow. after pivoting on the scanning ip, delivering the downloaders scripts, it is currently providing the same script with an updated temporary domain, which is currently delivering additional satori/fbot samples packed with upx.alien labs has identified the cyberium malware hosting domain to be providing many different mirai variants, like moobot or satori, during the last year. actors have been jumping between subdomains to recycle their infrastructure as most as possible. at the time of publishing this blog (may 2021) some of the cyberium subdomains were up, but they were not hosting any malware samples. they could be potentially awaiting new requests for c2 lists.several questions remain unanswered. why would the attackers deliver different mirai variants with different c2s on the same campaign? and, are they trying to avoid anti-virus detection through diversification of variants? or, are they trying to improve the botnet resiliency by diversifying c2.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.suricata ids signaturesalert http $external_net any -> $home_net any (msg:\"av exploit tenda router rce (cve-2020-10987)\"; flow:to_server,established;

            "{'titel': 'securing aws policies', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsaws policies are a key foundation in good cloud security, but they are often overlooked. in this blog, we take a quick look on some aws policies, particularly for\\xa0identity and access management\\xa0(iam), that could become problematic if not properly managed. we'll discuss how they can be used against us to generate attacks like: ransomware, data exfiltration, credential abuse, and more. finally, we'll suggest some open source tools for cloud policy assessment and pentesting.\\xa0\\xa0the first step in achieving good security is having effective policies to regulate what can and cannot be done in an environment, both physical devices and cloud infrastructure. these regulatory policies are frequently hard to define and keep up-to-date, especially in a fast-paced environment using infrastructure-as-a-service (iaas). this blog looks at some changes in policies\\xa0which can reduce success in some common attack types involving: exfiltration, ransomware, credential abuse, and more. for that reason, at&t alien labs is sharing an easy ‘what to look for’ list in order to detect some red flags in aws policy changes. it is our hope that this\\xa0list will be helpful\\xa0for security analysts and forensic investigators.policies are spoiler alert, defined by aws policies, which define permissions for identities and resources. every time\\xa0aws identity and access management makes a request of any kind to a resource, a policy determines if the iam is allowed or denied access to that specific resource under the policies for the involved parties.a full understanding of aws policies (types, creation, enforcement, etc.) is outside the scope of this\\xa0blog, but it can be found in aws documentation.people implementing aws policies should have knowledge of the organization, adapting\\xa0policies to needs of the business. afterwards, detection rules should be generated\\xa0for red flags in cloudtrail or other security tools. by doing this, we are avoiding policy changes in a generic manner, for example using ‘*’ to cover the whole principal without setting any conditions to it (mfa, ip, usernames, etc.). the problem resides in changes occurring on a daily basis to the policies, which are often overlooked by analysts. the impact that these changes could have\\xa0is as big as any other event or alert investigated.in order to classify all aws actions involving a policy change that could be used by attackers, we’ll sort them based on the potential final attack type. most of the following techniques would fall under modify cloud compute infrastructure (t1578) but we have attempted to classify them outside of their specific cloud technique - as if the activity was happening in a traditional environment.endpoint denial of service (t1499): adversaries may perform endpoint dos attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. this blockage could be used as an additional impact on top of data encrypted for impact (t1486) to avoid or slow down\\xa0recovery efforts in a ransomware attack. in this scenario, attackers could be trying to block access to several aws resources like: s3, ec2 through efs or ebs, or backups between others.s3: amazon’s storage service can suffer a dos by adding policies that block access to its contents. buckets and access points are both s3 resources that could be impacted by an excessively restrictive policy or access control list (acl), hence their relevance.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:denyaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)additionally, the events deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicy would have a similar effect, since they would be removing the policies where the public access is allowed.detection guidance:event/command:deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicyguardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)in a similar situation, amazon’s elastic file system (efs): any policy change denying access to this storage solution\\xa0could also lead to a dos. due to this, these\\xa0events and resource policies should be closely observed.detection guidance:event/commandputfilesystempolicyeffectdenyactionelasticfilesystem:clientmount or elasticfilesystem:clientwriteguardduty alert-indicator removal on host (t1070): adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files, such as quarantined malware. in this case, removed indicators not only affect the host, but the whole cloud and the log ingestion platform in charge of generating alerts. the main affected resource is cloudwatch, but there are others too.cloudwatch is\\xa0the monitoring service for aws resources\\xa0tracks logs coming from different resources and accounts in aws. blocking the logging access to resources would have a similar effect as deleting logs in a traditional computer.putresourcepolicy gives permission for other aws services to put log events to the current account. a new policy with effect deny on all\\xa0could avoid resources logging on their expected log file, and delay alerting on a detection. additionally, putdestinationpolicy has a similar\\xa0behavior - it has the capability of creating an access policy for existing log destinations. a restrictive policy could lead to a logs not being in the expected log location. in this case, putresourcepolicy api or cli does not allow specifying * as the principal, and each sender account must be listed separately in the policy.several guardduty finding types could notify of any policy log tampering that could impact detection of indicators.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicy or putdestinationpolicyeffect:denyaction:logs:*guardduty alert:stealth:s3/serveraccessloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/cloudtrailloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/loggingconfigurationmodifiedother log events could be of relevance, like putretentionpolicy, but none of their effects would be as drastic as the previously mentioned or are not strictly determined by policies.inhibit system recovery (t1490): blocking access to the backups or modifying permissions to delete them, most likely with ransomware intentions.efs offers an automatic backup system through the command putbackuppolicy, which could be disabled in a ransomware scenario causing slower recovery efforts.detection guidance:event/command:putbackuppolicystatus:disabledbackups: aws offers several solutions for backing up systems (as we have already seen with the efs solution). looking into the aws backup official solution and disabling it or removing permissions to access them has the direct impact of a dos, and aggravates the ransomware scenario.detection guidance:event/command:putbackupvaultaccesspolicyeffect:denyallowaction:backup:*backup:delete*guardduty alert:-exfiltration over web service (t1567): exposes current resources to the internet with the intention of exfiltrating data outside of the organization.s3: as we saw in the dos section, a change in policies could remove public internet access to a bucket or access point. in this situation we are looking at the opposite scenario, a private s3 being made public to leverage it for exfiltration purposes.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:allowaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/bucketpublicaccessgranted or policy:s3/bucketanonymousaccessgrantedelasticsearch: if the domain associated with an elasticsearch instance is public, an attacker could modify any existing condition, like ip addresses\\xa0or command restrictions - to increase the actions that can be performed on this public domain. aws does not have a specific command to modify its access policies for elasticsearch, but they can be modified from the user interface or the api through the domain config, on an individual domain basis.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:es:* (in particular es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig)guardduty alert:-attackers could also create a new elasticsearch domain and include the above-mentioned policies. it is outside the scope of this blog to discuss\\xa0operations involving new resources to exfiltrate data (elasticsearch, s3, efs, etc.). this attack would become noisier, since it involves creating new resources, applying the mentioned policies, and copying any relevant data to these resources. just for reference, this attack would classify as transfer data to cloud account (t1537).elastic container registry (ecr): provides the capability to store docker containers and have them ready for deployment. this deployment availability can also be turned around and be used for exfiltration by\\xa0downloading docker containers from a pre-signed amazon s3 download url. this privilege can be obtained by modifying the setrepositorypolicy for the corresponding ecr and allowing the action getdownloadurlforlayer to access it externally.detection guidance:event/command:setrepositorypolicy or putrepositorypolicyeffect:allowaction:ecr:getdownloadurlforlayerguardduty alert:-os credential dumping (t1003): uses a lack of security to dump credentials either encrypted, hashed or in clear text, to use them later in towards lateral movement or accessing confidential information.aws secrets manager is a great example of a target for a credential access scenario. the secrets in this vault need to be accessed by internal or external resources eventually, and a bad security policy might allow an attacker to take those credentials. these might be encrypted with a kms key, but attackers would still be one step closer to their their goal.an escalation of privileges (or decrease in security) could be achieved through the putresourcepolicy for secretsmanager. an excess of allowed privileges could make credential access easier.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:secretsmanager:* (in particular getsecretvalue)guardduty alert:-aws key management service (kms): is amazon’s key manager to control what users and applications have access to certain cryptographic keys. access to these keys is, as you can expect at this point of the blog, given by a specific policy. changes made to this policy can enable\\xa0several different attacks (like a dos if access is denied to all users), but in this case we are looking at a too permissive policy set with putkeypolicy.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:kms:putkeypolicyguardduty alert:-in addition to the already mentioned events and aws resources, there are others that could be leveraged by attackers, but these fall out of the scope of this blog to keep it a\\xa0reasonable length. just to mention some of these - they would be: amazon simple queue service (sqs) through sqs:addpermission, amazon simple notification service (amazon sns) through sns:addpermission, aws elemental mediastore through putcontainerpolicy, aws lambda through lambda:addpermission, etc.after analyzing some of the most relevant policy changes impacting the cloud environment’s security in your organization, we’ll take a look at some of the aws penetration testing tools available for free, and how they use\\xa0policies.aws offers an access analyzer capable of assessing existing resource-based policies, and focuses on identifying any resources shared with external entities. amazon refers to an external entity as any other aws account, root user, iam user or role, federated user, aws service, anonymous user, or other entity.it is a great resource for some critical resources like s3, kms or secretmanager. however, it lacks coverage to other resources that could be as important, like elasticsearch domains or cloudwatch resource policies.this free cloud pentesting tool provides a deep test of existing policies in aws. the only prerequisite is an aws api credential with privileges to update resource policies. it is capable of running in ‘expose’ mode, modifying just the necessary resources to achieve a backdoor, or ‘smash’ mode, revealing potential security concerns by: enumerating resources, reading and modifying current policies, and finally implanting as many backdoors as possible through weaknesses in the victim’s iam security policies.it offers approximately 30% more coverage than aws iam access analyzer, including coverage for:in the full list of policies required to achieve all the backdoors included with the tool, we can see some policies already mentioned in this blog: ecr:setrepositorypolicy, elasticfilesystem:putfilesystempolicy, es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig, kms:putkeypolicy, lambda:addpermission, logs:putresourcepolicy, s3:putbucketpolicy, secretsmanager:putresourcepolicy.cloudsplaining performs a deep assessment on all the aws iam security policies and identifies violations of least privilege, producing a full html report. the report includes triage items as well as remediation indications, offering the user a very helpful resource to analyze their current configuration and offering improvement possibilities.hacking the cloud is an online encyclopedia supported by volunteers. the webpage contains a list of attacks/tactics/techniques that offensive security professionals can use to pentest their cloud environments. the attacks are not very policy focused, but it does use them in some attacks, like in the “unauthenticated enumeration of iam users and roles”, which is present in pacu too.there are many other open source useful tools for cloud pentesting or policy assessment, like: parliament, pacu, pmapper, repokid, policy sentry.in this blog we have seen several attacks\\xa0that\\xa0could be performed using aws policies - especially if they weren’t properly set up. we've discussed\\xa0the\\xa0importance of aws policies as the foundation of a good cloud security. we have seen how guardduty detects some dangerous policy changes, but leaves out many others that can only be detected through constantly reviewing\\xa0cloudtrail logs. the pentesting tools seen in the blog can help detect holes in the policies. an alternative solution is the use of siems like usm anywhere, with specific detection rules added on a daily basis, thanks to the threat content that the at&t alien labs team adds to the usm anywhere platform.aws policies: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/latest/userguide/access_policies.htmlendgame: https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latestcloudsplaining: https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaininghacking the cloud: https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/connection-tracking/parliament: https://github.com/duo-labs/parliamentpacu: https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/pacu-open-source-aws-exploitation-framework/pmapper: https://github.com/nccgroup/pmapperrepokid: https://github.com/netflix/repokidpolicy sentry: https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry/the findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: ransomware, cloud security, attacks, labs, iam, aws security, open source, aws policyinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.\"}\n",
            "{'titel': 'the rise of qakbot', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was jointly written with ofer caspi. some of the links in this blog require an otx account, and the qakbot infrastructure tracker will require readers to be customers with access to the threat intel subscription.. thanks to the following researchers and the malwarebazaar project:at&t alien labs closely monitors the evolution of crimeware such as the qakbot\\xa0(also known as qbot) malware family and campaigns in connection with qakbot. the jointly coordinated takedown of the actors behind emotet in late january has left a gap in the cybercrime landscape, which qakbot seems poised to fill.key points:qakbot, also known as qbot or pinkslipbot, is a modular information stealer. it has been active since 2007 and primarily used by financially motivated actors. it was initially known as a banking trojan and a loader using c2 servers for payload delivery; however, its use expanded beyond strictly being a banking trojan. the hallmarks of a qakbot infection chain consist of a phishing lure (t1566) delivered via email chain hijacking or spoofed emails that contain context-aware information such as shipping, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, claims, etc. the phishing emails alternate between file attachments (t1566.001) and links (t1566.002). qakbot is often used as a gateway entry, similar to trickbot or emotet, that leads to post exploitation operations leveraging frameworks such as cobalt strike as well as delivering ransomware.qakbot email lures are not the most sophisticated; however, by using contextually aware themes that originate from hijacked email chains or potentially compromised accounts within a user’s social circle, they are effective. figure 1 below illustrates an example of a recent qakbot lure with the subject “re: signed quote” and a zip file attachment labeled “cancellation_letter_272020508-02242021.zip”.figure 1. qakbot \"signed quote\" email lurethe actors further establish the trust and confidence of the targeted user by presenting a semi-official looking docusign graphic that guides the user through the process of enabling the excel 4 macros. a representative sample, 78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a, seen in a recent qakbot campaign is shown in figure 2 below.figure 2. qakbot docusign lureqakbot excel spreadsheets often contain hidden spreadsheets, excel 4.0 macros, spreadsheet formulas, and biff records all designed to pass a visual inspection from the user with the added benefit of bypassing detection mechanisms that attempt to parse multiple legacy formats inside the spreadsheet. figure 3 below shows a screenshot of output from the open-source xlmmacrodeobfuscator tool, which decodes obfuscated excel 4.0 macros.figure 3. xlmmacrodeobfuscator output for a qakbot excel 4.0 macro spreadsheetonce the excel 4.0 macro is decoded it is possible to see the call to urldownloadtofilea, which downloads the qakbot dll in this campaign from http[:]//rlyrt26rnxw02vqijgs[.]com/fera/frid[.]gif. next, the exec function is evaluated which executes “rundll32.exe nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver”. it is also a common tactic for qakbot to execute “regsvr32.exe -s nxckew.wle,dllregisterserver”. both instances are designed to evade sandbox environments that do not supply the expected command line arguments. a representative qakbot dll analyzed by alien labs, 9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28, has two exports: the entry point (0x10005a5d) and dllregisterserver (0x10029c88)and if dllregisterserver is not called via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe with command line options, then only the entry point is called and the malicious code in dllregisterserver is not called. figure 3 below shows improved readability and de-obfuscation of the macro by manually replacing and substituting the cell values and formulas.figure 3. better de-obfuscation of the spreadsheetthe results of our additional de-obfuscation efforts are confirmed when the qakbot excel spreadsheet is run inside a sandbox in figure 4 below.figure 4. otx screenshot showing the “rundll32 ..\\\\nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver\\'\\' executionbefore executing the main payload, the qakbot loader will first test the infected system to see if it is a good candidate for infection. the qakbot loader is responsible for checking its environment to include whether it is running on a virtual machine, identifying any installed and running security and monitoring tools such as antivirus products or common security researcher tools. figure 5 below shows a high-level execution flow of the qakbot loader.figure 5. qakbot execution flowto make detection and analysis harder, qakbot encrypts its strings and decrypts them at runtime before use. once the qakbot execution logic is finished using a string, it will immediately delete the string from memory. an example of this can be seen in figure 6 below, which shows qakbot decrypting a string containing the value for lpprocname passed as a parameter to the getprocaddress api call. the selected function, which has been labeled in ida pro as, “oc_clear_mem” deletes the string memory right after it retrieves the process address.figure 6. qakbot getprocaddress and clear_mem routineswhen executed, qakbot will check whether it has previously been executed on the machine by checking for the specified malware folder. if qakbot discovers it is a first time run, it will relaunch itself from cmd.exe with the /c parameter that will inform the loader to proceed and run its anti-vm checks on the machine and return the results to the parent process. if qakbot detects it is running in a vm environment, then the final payload will not be decrypted since qakbot uses the return value from these checks in its final decryption routine. figure 7 below shows the qakbot environment check logic.figure 7. qakbot environment check logicspecifically, qakbot checks the system for the names of running processes that match the strings listed in table 1 below.process namesfigure 8 below shows the decryption routine for the security and monitoring tool strings (t1140).figure 8. qakbot decrypting tool check stringsqakbot will also add its folder to the windows defender exclusions setting located in the registry (t1112), which prevents defender from scanning qakbot artifacts. the registry location can be seen in figure 9 below.figure 9. qakbot adding exclusion paths to windows defender settingsin addition to the previously mentioned environment check, qakbot collects system information (t1082) such as computer name, system directories, user profiles, and more, which is shown in figure 10 below.figure 10. qakbot system information collectionqakbot will use process hollowing (t1055.012) in order to inject itself into explorer.exe. if it is unsuccessful then qakbot will attempt to inject itself into mobsync.exe or iexplore.exe. the screen shot in figure 11 illustrates the qakbot process name decryption routine.\\xa0figure 11. qakbot routine to decrypt process names for injectionfigure 12 below shows the qakbot logic to overwrite the suspended explorer.exe process and then resume its execution.figure 12. qakbot process hollowing routineadditionally, qakbot abuses the service control manager (scm) to create a child process, which is then detached from the parent when the scm terminates the parent process. qakbot c2 communications begin in this stage to make it more difficult to monitor. figure 13 below shows the scm spawned process abuse technique.figure 13. qakbot abusing scm to spawn a detached processfigure 14 below shows the qakbot c2 ping during the scm interaction.figure 14. qakbot sending c2 pingfinally, if the qakbot loader has verified its execution environment has passed its tests, then qakbot will proceed to decrypt and execute the main qakbot payload, which is hidden as resource “307”. the decryption and import table resolution of its main payload is shown in figure 15 below.figure 15. qakbot decryption and import table resolution of main payloadthe combined anti-analysis and evasion techniques across the infection chain significantly impair antivirus, edr, and other security defenses from detecting and preventing the initial infection. despite the limitations and challenges presented by qakbot dlls there is ample opportunity to detect qakbot loaders signed by revoked and blacklisted malicious certificates. alien labs has identified 42 unique signers and signature serial numbers, which are included in detection methods section to aid in detection and hunting with yara and osquery. additionally, there are a number of behavioral patterns, indicators of behavior (iob), which provide opportunities for detection.alien labs has observed qakbot over the past three months being used in a role similar to trickbot, which includes malspam delivery, stealthy maldocs dropping signed loaders, establishing a foothold, and finally post exploitation activities such as lateral movement, access operations, and ransomware delivery. alien labs actively tracks the qakbot c2 infrastructure for customers, which is available via otx here.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by defenders to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.agent signatures\\xa0the following technical indicators are associated with the reported

which has been previously observed targeting exposed docker infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining purposes and credential theft. the group is using a new detection evasion tool, copied from open source repositories.the purpose of this blog\\xa0is to share new technical intelligence and provide detection and analysis options for defenders.at&t alien labs previously reported on teamtnt cryptomining malware using a new memory loader based on ezuri and written in golang. since then, teamtnt has added another tool to their list of capabilities.the objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.the tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on github, described as \"hide a process under linux using the ld preloader.\\'\\' preloading allows the system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. if the custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the system libraries, the custom version will override it.the tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.the new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the teamtnt cryptominer binary or ircbot (figure 1):figure 1. base64 encoded script, via alien labs analysis.upon binary execution, the bash script will run through a multitude of tasks. specifically, the script will:after decoding, we can observe the bash script functionality and how some malicious activity occurs before the shared library is created (figure 2):figure 2. decoded bash script, via alien labs analysis.the new tool is first dropped as a hidden tar file on disk, the script decompresses it, writes it to \\'/usr/local/lib/systemhealt.so\\', and then adds it preload via \\'/etc/ld.so.preload\\'. this will be used by the system to preload the file before other system libraries, allowing the attacker to override some common functions (figure 3/4).figure 3/4. bash script features, via alien labs analysis.the main purpose of the tool is to hide the teamtnt bot from process viewer tools, which use the file \\'/usr/bin/sbin\\' as you can see in figure 3 and 4 (setup_ircbot function).as final step, the malware will remove traces by deleting bash history:figure 5. bash script cleanup, via alien labs analysis.through the use of libprocesshider, teamtnt once again expands their capabilities based on the available open source tools. while the new functionality of libprocesshider is to evade detection and other basic functions, it acts as an indicator to consider when hunting for malicious activity on the host level. alien labs will continue to monitor the threat and report on any

            "{'titel': 'lazarus campaign ttps and evolution', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs™ has observed new activity that has been attributed to the lazarus adversary group potentially targeting engineering job candidates and/or employees in classified engineering roles within the u.s. and europe. this assessment is based on malicious documents believed to have been delivered by lazarus during the last few months (spring 2021). however, historical analysis shows the lures used in this campaign to be in line with others used to target these groups.the purpose of this blog is to share the new technical intelligence and provide detection options for defenders. alien labs will continue to report on any noteworthy changes.key takeaways:since 2009, the known tools and capabilities believed to have been used by the lazarus group include ddos botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (rats), and drive wiper malware. the most publicly documented malware and tools used by the group actors include destover, duuzer, and hangman.several documents identified from may to june 2021 by twitter users were identified as being linked to the lazarus group. documents observed in previous campaigns lured victims with job opportunities for boeing and bae systems. these new documents include:the documents attempted to impersonate new defense contractors and engineering companies like airbus, general motors (gm), and rheinmetall. all of these documents contain macro malware, which has been developed and improved during the course of this campaign and from one target to another. the core techniques for the three malicious documents are the same, but the attackers attempted to reduce the potential detections and increase the faculties of the macros.the first two documents from early may 2021 were related to a german engineering company focused on the defense and automotive industries, rheinmetall. the second malicious document appears to include more elaborate content, which may have resulted in the documents going unnoticed by victims.the macro has base64 encoded files, which are extracted and decoded during execution. some of the files are split inside the macro and are not combined until the time of decoding. one of the most distinctive characteristics of this macro is how it evades detections of a mz header encoded in base64 (tvoa, tvpb, tvpq, tvqa, tvqq or tvro), by separating the first two characters from the rest of the content, as seen in figure 1.figure 1: concealing of mz header, as captured by alien labs.the rest of the content is kept together in lines of 64 characters, and because of this, yara rules can be used to detect other, typical executable content encoded in base64 aside of the mz header. in this case, up to nine different yara rules alerted to suspicious encoded strings in our alien labs analysis, like virtualprotect, getprocaddress, isdebuggerpresent, getcurrentprocessid, etc.figure 2: yara rules detections listed in the at&t alien labs open threat exchange, otx.all files created by the executable and used by the different macros are located in a new folder c:/drivers with the purpose of masquerading their activity. the macro copies and renames the microsoft legitimate executable certutil.exe into this folder. the reason for this copy is to avoid endpoint detection and response (edr) signatures based on system utilities executed from non-standard sources (a microsoft office document in this case). additionally, the copy of certutil is disguised to avoid using the full string, by partially replacing it with an asterisk %systemroot%\\\\system32\\\\certut*.exe. as seen in later iterations, this technique was slightly modified to further reduce the number of detections.certutil is used to decode the previously mentioned file, doing it within the same folder and with a different executable name. once the necessary files have been decoded, the encoded files are removed from the system.the script queries wmi to list all the explorer.exe processes, where it will try to inject the malicious payload. for the injection, the attackers used mavinject (a legitimate windows component that can be used and abused) to perform arbitrary code injections inside any running process. mavinject.exe has been abused for several years, as indicated in this blog from 2017.figure 3: mavinject injection to explorer, as captured by alien labs.figure 4: malicious document execution tree listed in the at&t alien labs otx.the payload is in fact a downloader, which requests the next stage to a hardcoded command and control (c&c) server and saves it to a new file. this request is made through https with hardcoded headers. in this case, the domain used as c&c has been registered for several years, and the domain continues to have a long expiration date. for these reasons, this domain was assessed as a compromised domain, leveraged by lazarus as c&c.figure 5: hardcoded http headers, as captured by alien labs.a few weeks after the rheinmetall document was observed, a very similar document emerged targeting general motors. the characteristics of this document were very similar to the previous one, but with minor updates in the c&c communication process.after attempting to execute all its code, the macro reports back to the c&c server with the status of the infection. in the code, a variable is updated from 1 to 3, signaling the status of the execution. the c&c is capable of tracking where its execution is failing, or encountering unexpected behavior, based on the requests made to the different documents in the c&c. this includes:the status report to the c&c also requests the lure document, which at this moment is downloaded from the same c&c and opened.figure 6: c&c beacon to report execution status, as captured by alien labs.the domain used in this document and payload allgraphicart[.]com is no longer a compromised domain. it was first registered on april 1, 2021. however, it did not have any noteworthy activity until these malicious documents showed up, at least a month after the domain was registered. the domain was registered with porkbun llc, who offers domains with the free option of protecting the whois information.in early june, a month after the first document of this campaign was observed, a new document was identified targeting airbus. this time, the c&c communications were very similar to the previous iteration of the document; however, the execution and injection processes were different.this document continues utilizing and masquerading certutil, but the copy command had the minor addition of another asterisk to reduce the detection risk: %systemroot%\\\\system32\\\\*ertut*.exe. in addition to certutil, the legitimate explorer executable is copied to the c:\\\\drivers folder through a similar method %systemroot%\\\\exp*.exe. as previously mentioned, these files will be copied and renamed to avoid edr signature-based detections, but this time the destination filenames were carefully chosen. if alphabetically ordered, the first two files will correspond to legitimate software, followed by the malicious files, which could mislead investigators on their first peak on the c:\\\\drivers folder.this macro contains three files encoded with base64 which are copied to disk and decoded during execution:after the actions, the macro executes the mentioned payload with an updated technique. the attackers are no longer using mavinject, but directly executing the payload with explorer.exe, significantly modifying the resulting execution tree as seen in figure 10. once the payload has been executed, the macro waits for three seconds before creating of an .inf file in the same folder. whether it was successfully executed or not, the macro will proceed to send the beacon to the c&c with the execution status and delete all the temporary files, attempting to clean their tracks. the only files left in c:\\\\drivers\\\\ at this point are the payload and the .inf file.figure 7: malicious document execution tree, as captured by at&t alien labs.the new c&c shopweblive[.]com follows the same pattern and characteristics of the one used in the second iteration.the reported activity remains in line with the lazarus’ past campaigns and is not expected to be the last. attack lures, potentially targeting engineering professionals in government organizations, showcase the importance of tracking lazarus and their evolution. we continue to see lazarus using the same tactic, techniques, and procedures that we have observed in the past, such as using microsoft office documents that download remote templates, microsoft office macros, and compromised third party infrastructure to host the payloads and proxy c&c traffic through. at&t alien labs will continue to monitor and report on any noteworthy changes.the following associated detection methods are in use

(by default, the malware will encrypt the current directory and its subfolders.)during execution, the malware will first check if its configuration exists. the configuration file format is very similar to the one observed for revil windows samples, but with fewer fields. some of the fields presented in both versions include:figure 2: hard-coded config file, as captured by alien labs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0figure 3: hard-coded ransom note after decoding, as captured by alien labs.the malware will loop through the target folder, encrypting the files in it. before encryption, it will check to see if the file has already been encrypted by looking at the filename extension.during encryption, the malware will generate a 64 bytes xor key, based on the pk key given in the config file. it will use this key during the encryption process. after encryption, the malware will write the generated key “iv” at the end of each file and leave a ransom note in each folder.figure 4: main encryption routine, as captured by alien labs.figure 5: main encryption routine, as captured by alien labs.the malware will log all the files it goes through, stating if the file was encrypted or if it was unable to encrypt due to os protection.figure 6: encryption logs, as captured by alien labs.figure 7: execution output, as captured by alien labs. .the threat actors behind revil raas have rapidly developed a linux version to compete against the recently released linux version of darkside. it is hard to clarify if these two raas are competing against each other or collaborating team members, as stated by other security researchers. nevertheless, both actors have been very active in the ransomware landscape during the last months, and these upgrades will keep them in the spotlight due to the increased attacking spectrum.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence. a list of indicators is also available in the otx pulse. please note, the pulse may include other activities related but out of the scope of the report.\\xa0typeindicatordescriptionsha256ea1872b2835128e3cb49a0bc27e4727ca33c4e6eba1e80422db19b505f965bc4revil linux samplesha256d6762eff16452434ac1acc127f082906cc1ae5b0ff026d0d4fe725711db47763revil linux samplesha256796800face046765bd79f267c56a6c93ee2800b76d7f38ad96e5acb92599fcd4revil linux samplesha2563d375d0ead2b63168de86ca2649360d9dcff75b3e0ffa2cf1e50816ec92b3b7drevil linux samplethe findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: malware, alien labs, otx pulse, ransomware, security, linux, labs, raas, revilinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",
            "{'titel': 'darkside raas in linux version', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs recently analyzed the linux version of the darkside ransomware, one of the most active ransomware in the last quarter. shortly after hitting colonial pipeline, darkside developers announced they would be closing operations.linux and unix servers have always been a preferred option for servers and data centers, likely due to the small attack surface of the servers, tight configurations, and lack of user interaction. however, they are often set up and then forgotten, left without detection or protection mechanisms. this makes them very attractive to attackers. by infecting unprotected virtualization servers, attackers can perform devastating attacks on companies, taking down all the services of a company with a single infection.first discovered in august 2020, darkside is a group that operates ransomware as a service (raas), and attacks by their network of affiliates have infected many companies worldwide. the most high profile infection happened when a darkside affiliate hit the network of one of the major oil pipeline companies\\xa0in the us, colonial pipeline, causing the company to shut down operations for days. after this attack — likely due to the fact that it drew unwanted levels of attention to the group globally — the malware authors announced publicly the closure of their service. nevertheless, there is evidence that the group has completed a linux version of its malware that is targeting esxi, servers hosting vmware virtual machines. to this point, the authors announced the darkside 2.0 version with linux capabilities on march 9, 2021 in the xss forum:figure 1. example of linux version features and information announced by malware authors on xss forum. \\xa0unlike the windows version of the malware that targets any windows endpoint, darkside linux version is mostly targeting esxi servers. its default configuration includes the root path of esx server machines. \\xa0targeted extensions are 'vmdk', 'log', 'vmem', 'vmsn' that are used in esx servers for saving virtual machines information, data, and logs.the malware is quite informative and prints to the screen most of the actions it performs, which is an uncommon behavior for malware. this could imply that the malware is being deployed manually. the malware is written in c++ and it’s also using several open-source libraries that were imported and compiled with the malware code into one binary. some of these libraries are: crypto++\\xa0used for encryption, boost\\xa0used for logging purposes, and curl\\xa0used for http requests. the use of these libraries enables the final binary to be a 2.7mb file size. for example, to communicate with an infected machine with its command and control (c&c), the malware uses libcurl functions that were compiled with the rest of the code.in addition, the malware supports command line parameters during execution to replace almost, if not all, of the default configuration variables.figure 2. parameters supported by the malware.the malware also supports shutting down virtual machines by executing the

            "{'titel': 'malware hosting domain cyberium fanning out mirai variants', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs has observed the mirai variant botnet, known as moobot, scanning for known but uncommon vulnerabilities in tenda routers, resulting in a considerable peak in our internal telemetry. the research associated with this peak resulted in the discovery of a malware hosting domain, providing several different mirai variants, like moobot and satori.key points:during the end of march, at&t alien labs observed a spike in exploitation attempts for tenda remote code execution (rce) vulnerability cve-2020-10987. this spike was observed throughout a significant number of clients, in the space of a few hours. this vulnerability is not commonly used by web scanners and was barely detected by our honeypots during the last six months, except for a minor peak in november.this exploit can be identified by the url that is requested, which includes ‘setusbunload’ with the payload assigned to the vulnerable parameter ‘devicename’. this payload contains the logic to change the execution path to a temporary location, wget a file from a malware hosting page, provide execution permissions, and execute it.figure 1. binaryedge sensor detecting the vulnerability scan.following this thread, a single actor was identified to be behind these scans in late march — at the time, the actor appeared to have no previous activity. the scan for tenda vulnerable routers only lasted one day, but the scanning activity continued for several weeks, including the below vulnerabilities:some of these exploit attempts were captured by honeypots. all of them appeared to be pulling their next iteration of the malware from the same malware hosting page: dns.cyberium[.]cc.when this domain was investigated, several campaigns were identified, going back at least one year to may 2020. most of the attacks lasted for approximately a week while they hosted several mirai variants, after which they left the subdomain unresolvable. however, this seems to be the behavior of the threat actor in between operations. the actors appear to come back to the same domain with a new subdomain for each new campaign. activity in between campaigns goes quiet to increase the trust of the original domain. keeping a long-running existing domain while issuing brand new one domain helps to divert attention to the new domain and thus distract from the original.figure 2. riskiq heatmap of cyberium[.]cc.the full list of subdomains/campaigns identified from this domain is:we were able to identify other infrastructure that we assess with high confidence is controlled by the same actor and has been used as moobot command and control in the past.all of the domains use the same:the first request to these malware hosting pages was for a bash script, which aimed to download later stages of the malware. as seen in the screenshot below, the script attempts to download a list of filenames (associated with different cpu architectures), executes each one of them, achieves persistence through a crontab that redownloads the bash script itself, and finally deletes itself.figure 3. tenda downloader script.this script is very similar to downloaders previously seen for mirai variants. the minor modifications appear to be on the downloading server, persistence methods (if any) and the filename, usually named after the vulnerable device vendor.during the time this domain was available and delivering malware, at least three different variants of mirai were identified: moobot, satori/fbot, and other samples unassociated with these botnets. one of the peculiarities of this domain was how it juggled between mirai variants, even under the same filenames. the same url could be hosting satori one day and moobot the week after.in october 2020, lacework\\xa0reported on a new mirai variant called moobot. this variant mainly chased exposed and vulnerable dockers apis to include them into their ddos botnet. one of the main distinctions of this variant has been a hardcoded string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, compared to the mirai source code which used the string “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw012345678” as a seed to generate an alphanumeric string. this random string is used several times throughout the code, one of them to generate the process name to be used during execution.many samples available at cyberium contained the above-mentioned string and this domain was already being used to distribute this botnet when lacework first reported on it. however, the number of samples alien labs has seen with that string has greatly increased in the last months, scattering from the original moobot sample. this could potentially mean that last year\\'s moobots samples were used to create new branches of mirai variants.unlike some other mirai variants, the samples obtained from moobot were encrypted, attempting to evade string-based detection, static analysis of the exploits used, or after compromised activities. however, it did maintain other previously seen characteristics, like a hardcoded list of ip addresses\\xa0to avoid, such as: private ranges, the department of defense, iana ips, ge, hp and others.figure 4. moobot’s ip scan restrictions.the malware writers appear to be very aware of who they’re potential victims are. for this reason, the malware will try to hide its process name by changing it using prctl. the covert process name is “/var/sofia”, which is the name of a video application on the targeted devices.figure 5. moobot process hideout.right after hiding the process, this sample will print to screen the string “9xsspnvgc8aj5pi7m28p” which has been associated with different mirai variants over time (fbot\\xa0and gafgyt). however, it appears this is a passed down characteristic through variant versions, like previously seen with “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, but this time there aren’t any shared iocs with previous attackers.after successful infection, the payload attempts to query the hardcoded c2 on port 12028 to get a list of c2. at the time of study, the cyberium domain was down, and these communications couldn’t be analyzed.early in march 2021, the same links previously mentioned for moobot, for example dns.cyberium[.]cc/arm, were actually providing samples for satori. the satori botnet, also known as fbot, is yet another mirai variant based botnet. unexpectedly, these samples were mingled with other unix botnets in the same malware hosting server.the similarities between moobot and satori samples are vast, since they both are coming from the same mirai source code. these similarities include:the most noteworthy differences observed were:additional samples were identified under the same domain, which on a first investigation appeared to be a mix between the already mentioned moobot and satori samples with a random combination of their characteristics. most of them looked like moobot samples without the encoding or satori without the hardcoded domain.however, the samples are not associated with the current domain under study, probably because it is being left fallow. after pivoting on the scanning ip, delivering the downloaders scripts, it is currently providing the same script with an updated temporary domain, which is currently delivering additional satori/fbot samples packed with upx.alien labs has identified the cyberium malware hosting domain to be providing many different mirai variants, like moobot or satori, during the last year. actors have been jumping between subdomains to recycle their infrastructure as most as possible. at the time of publishing this blog (may 2021) some of the cyberium subdomains were up, but they were not hosting any malware samples. they could be potentially awaiting new requests for c2 lists.several questions remain unanswered. why would the attackers deliver different mirai variants with different c2s on the same campaign? and, are they trying to avoid anti-virus detection through diversification of variants? or, are they trying to improve the botnet resiliency by diversifying c2.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.suricata ids signaturesalert http $external_net any -> $home_net any (msg:\"av exploit tenda router rce (cve-2020-10987)\"; flow:to_server,established;

            "{'titel': 'securing aws policies', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsaws policies are a key foundation in good cloud security, but they are often overlooked. in this blog, we take a quick look on some aws policies, particularly for\\xa0identity and access management\\xa0(iam), that could become problematic if not properly managed. we'll discuss how they can be used against us to generate attacks like: ransomware, data exfiltration, credential abuse, and more. finally, we'll suggest some open source tools for cloud policy assessment and pentesting.\\xa0\\xa0the first step in achieving good security is having effective policies to regulate what can and cannot be done in an environment, both physical devices and cloud infrastructure. these regulatory policies are frequently hard to define and keep up-to-date, especially in a fast-paced environment using infrastructure-as-a-service (iaas). this blog looks at some changes in policies\\xa0which can reduce success in some common attack types involving: exfiltration, ransomware, credential abuse, and more. for that reason, at&t alien labs is sharing an easy ‘what to look for’ list in order to detect some red flags in aws policy changes. it is our hope that this\\xa0list will be helpful\\xa0for security analysts and forensic investigators.policies are spoiler alert, defined by aws policies, which define permissions for identities and resources. every time\\xa0aws identity and access management makes a request of any kind to a resource, a policy determines if the iam is allowed or denied access to that specific resource under the policies for the involved parties.a full understanding of aws policies (types, creation, enforcement, etc.) is outside the scope of this\\xa0blog, but it can be found in aws documentation.people implementing aws policies should have knowledge of the organization, adapting\\xa0policies to needs of the business. afterwards, detection rules should be generated\\xa0for red flags in cloudtrail or other security tools. by doing this, we are avoiding policy changes in a generic manner, for example using ‘*’ to cover the whole principal without setting any conditions to it (mfa, ip, usernames, etc.). the problem resides in changes occurring on a daily basis to the policies, which are often overlooked by analysts. the impact that these changes could have\\xa0is as big as any other event or alert investigated.in order to classify all aws actions involving a policy change that could be used by attackers, we’ll sort them based on the potential final attack type. most of the following techniques would fall under modify cloud compute infrastructure (t1578) but we have attempted to classify them outside of their specific cloud technique - as if the activity was happening in a traditional environment.endpoint denial of service (t1499): adversaries may perform endpoint dos attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. this blockage could be used as an additional impact on top of data encrypted for impact (t1486) to avoid or slow down\\xa0recovery efforts in a ransomware attack. in this scenario, attackers could be trying to block access to several aws resources like: s3, ec2 through efs or ebs, or backups between others.s3: amazon’s storage service can suffer a dos by adding policies that block access to its contents. buckets and access points are both s3 resources that could be impacted by an excessively restrictive policy or access control list (acl), hence their relevance.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:denyaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)additionally, the events deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicy would have a similar effect, since they would be removing the policies where the public access is allowed.detection guidance:event/command:deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicyguardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)in a similar situation, amazon’s elastic file system (efs): any policy change denying access to this storage solution\\xa0could also lead to a dos. due to this, these\\xa0events and resource policies should be closely observed.detection guidance:event/commandputfilesystempolicyeffectdenyactionelasticfilesystem:clientmount or elasticfilesystem:clientwriteguardduty alert-indicator removal on host (t1070): adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files, such as quarantined malware. in this case, removed indicators not only affect the host, but the whole cloud and the log ingestion platform in charge of generating alerts. the main affected resource is cloudwatch, but there are others too.cloudwatch is\\xa0the monitoring service for aws resources\\xa0tracks logs coming from different resources and accounts in aws. blocking the logging access to resources would have a similar effect as deleting logs in a traditional computer.putresourcepolicy gives permission for other aws services to put log events to the current account. a new policy with effect deny on all\\xa0could avoid resources logging on their expected log file, and delay alerting on a detection. additionally, putdestinationpolicy has a similar\\xa0behavior - it has the capability of creating an access policy for existing log destinations. a restrictive policy could lead to a logs not being in the expected log location. in this case, putresourcepolicy api or cli does not allow specifying * as the principal, and each sender account must be listed separately in the policy.several guardduty finding types could notify of any policy log tampering that could impact detection of indicators.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicy or putdestinationpolicyeffect:denyaction:logs:*guardduty alert:stealth:s3/serveraccessloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/cloudtrailloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/loggingconfigurationmodifiedother log events could be of relevance, like putretentionpolicy, but none of their effects would be as drastic as the previously mentioned or are not strictly determined by policies.inhibit system recovery (t1490): blocking access to the backups or modifying permissions to delete them, most likely with ransomware intentions.efs offers an automatic backup system through the command putbackuppolicy, which could be disabled in a ransomware scenario causing slower recovery efforts.detection guidance:event/command:putbackuppolicystatus:disabledbackups: aws offers several solutions for backing up systems (as we have already seen with the efs solution). looking into the aws backup official solution and disabling it or removing permissions to access them has the direct impact of a dos, and aggravates the ransomware scenario.detection guidance:event/command:putbackupvaultaccesspolicyeffect:denyallowaction:backup:*backup:delete*guardduty alert:-exfiltration over web service (t1567): exposes current resources to the internet with the intention of exfiltrating data outside of the organization.s3: as we saw in the dos section, a change in policies could remove public internet access to a bucket or access point. in this situation we are looking at the opposite scenario, a private s3 being made public to leverage it for exfiltration purposes.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:allowaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/bucketpublicaccessgranted or policy:s3/bucketanonymousaccessgrantedelasticsearch: if the domain associated with an elasticsearch instance is public, an attacker could modify any existing condition, like ip addresses\\xa0or command restrictions - to increase the actions that can be performed on this public domain. aws does not have a specific command to modify its access policies for elasticsearch, but they can be modified from the user interface or the api through the domain config, on an individual domain basis.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:es:* (in particular es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig)guardduty alert:-attackers could also create a new elasticsearch domain and include the above-mentioned policies. it is outside the scope of this blog to discuss\\xa0operations involving new resources to exfiltrate data (elasticsearch, s3, efs, etc.). this attack would become noisier, since it involves creating new resources, applying the mentioned policies, and copying any relevant data to these resources. just for reference, this attack would classify as transfer data to cloud account (t1537).elastic container registry (ecr): provides the capability to store docker containers and have them ready for deployment. this deployment availability can also be turned around and be used for exfiltration by\\xa0downloading docker containers from a pre-signed amazon s3 download url. this privilege can be obtained by modifying the setrepositorypolicy for the corresponding ecr and allowing the action getdownloadurlforlayer to access it externally.detection guidance:event/command:setrepositorypolicy or putrepositorypolicyeffect:allowaction:ecr:getdownloadurlforlayerguardduty alert:-os credential dumping (t1003): uses a lack of security to dump credentials either encrypted, hashed or in clear text, to use them later in towards lateral movement or accessing confidential information.aws secrets manager is a great example of a target for a credential access scenario. the secrets in this vault need to be accessed by internal or external resources eventually, and a bad security policy might allow an attacker to take those credentials. these might be encrypted with a kms key, but attackers would still be one step closer to their their goal.an escalation of privileges (or decrease in security) could be achieved through the putresourcepolicy for secretsmanager. an excess of allowed privileges could make credential access easier.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:secretsmanager:* (in particular getsecretvalue)guardduty alert:-aws key management service (kms): is amazon’s key manager to control what users and applications have access to certain cryptographic keys. access to these keys is, as you can expect at this point of the blog, given by a specific policy. changes made to this policy can enable\\xa0several different attacks (like a dos if access is denied to all users), but in this case we are looking at a too permissive policy set with putkeypolicy.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:kms:putkeypolicyguardduty alert:-in addition to the already mentioned events and aws resources, there are others that could be leveraged by attackers, but these fall out of the scope of this blog to keep it a\\xa0reasonable length. just to mention some of these - they would be: amazon simple queue service (sqs) through sqs:addpermission, amazon simple notification service (amazon sns) through sns:addpermission, aws elemental mediastore through putcontainerpolicy, aws lambda through lambda:addpermission, etc.after analyzing some of the most relevant policy changes impacting the cloud environment’s security in your organization, we’ll take a look at some of the aws penetration testing tools available for free, and how they use\\xa0policies.aws offers an access analyzer capable of assessing existing resource-based policies, and focuses on identifying any resources shared with external entities. amazon refers to an external entity as any other aws account, root user, iam user or role, federated user, aws service, anonymous user, or other entity.it is a great resource for some critical resources like s3, kms or secretmanager. however, it lacks coverage to other resources that could be as important, like elasticsearch domains or cloudwatch resource policies.this free cloud pentesting tool provides a deep test of existing policies in aws. the only prerequisite is an aws api credential with privileges to update resource policies. it is capable of running in ‘expose’ mode, modifying just the necessary resources to achieve a backdoor, or ‘smash’ mode, revealing potential security concerns by: enumerating resources, reading and modifying current policies, and finally implanting as many backdoors as possible through weaknesses in the victim’s iam security policies.it offers approximately 30% more coverage than aws iam access analyzer, including coverage for:in the full list of policies required to achieve all the backdoors included with the tool, we can see some policies already mentioned in this blog: ecr:setrepositorypolicy, elasticfilesystem:putfilesystempolicy, es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig, kms:putkeypolicy, lambda:addpermission, logs:putresourcepolicy, s3:putbucketpolicy, secretsmanager:putresourcepolicy.cloudsplaining performs a deep assessment on all the aws iam security policies and identifies violations of least privilege, producing a full html report. the report includes triage items as well as remediation indications, offering the user a very helpful resource to analyze their current configuration and offering improvement possibilities.hacking the cloud is an online encyclopedia supported by volunteers. the webpage contains a list of attacks/tactics/techniques that offensive security professionals can use to pentest their cloud environments. the attacks are not very policy focused, but it does use them in some attacks, like in the “unauthenticated enumeration of iam users and roles”, which is present in pacu too.there are many other open source useful tools for cloud pentesting or policy assessment, like: parliament, pacu, pmapper, repokid, policy sentry.in this blog we have seen several attacks\\xa0that\\xa0could be performed using aws policies - especially if they weren’t properly set up. we've discussed\\xa0the\\xa0importance of aws policies as the foundation of a good cloud security. we have seen how guardduty detects some dangerous policy changes, but leaves out many others that can only be detected through constantly reviewing\\xa0cloudtrail logs. the pentesting tools seen in the blog can help detect holes in the policies. an alternative solution is the use of siems like usm anywhere, with specific detection rules added on a daily basis, thanks to the threat content that the at&t alien labs team adds to the usm anywhere platform.aws policies: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/latest/userguide/access_policies.htmlendgame: https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latestcloudsplaining: https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaininghacking the cloud: https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/connection-tracking/parliament: https://github.com/duo-labs/parliamentpacu: https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/pacu-open-source-aws-exploitation-framework/pmapper: https://github.com/nccgroup/pmapperrepokid: https://github.com/netflix/repokidpolicy sentry: https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry/the findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: ransomware, cloud security, attacks, labs, iam, aws security, open source, aws policyinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.\"}\n",
            "{'titel': 'the rise of qakbot', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was jointly written with ofer caspi. some of the links in this blog require an otx account, and the qakbot infrastructure tracker will require readers to be customers with access to the threat intel subscription.. thanks to the following researchers and the malwarebazaar project:at&t alien labs closely monitors the evolution of crimeware such as the qakbot\\xa0(also known as qbot) malware family and campaigns in connection with qakbot. the jointly coordinated takedown of the actors behind emotet in late january has left a gap in the cybercrime landscape, which qakbot seems poised to fill.key points:qakbot, also known as qbot or pinkslipbot, is a modular information stealer. it has been active since 2007 and primarily used by financially motivated actors. it was initially known as a banking trojan and a loader using c2 servers for payload delivery; however, its use expanded beyond strictly being a banking trojan. the hallmarks of a qakbot infection chain consist of a phishing lure (t1566) delivered via email chain hijacking or spoofed emails that contain context-aware information such as shipping, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, claims, etc. the phishing emails alternate between file attachments (t1566.001) and links (t1566.002). qakbot is often used as a gateway entry, similar to trickbot or emotet, that leads to post exploitation operations leveraging frameworks such as cobalt strike as well as delivering ransomware.qakbot email lures are not the most sophisticated; however, by using contextually aware themes that originate from hijacked email chains or potentially compromised accounts within a user’s social circle, they are effective. figure 1 below illustrates an example of a recent qakbot lure with the subject “re: signed quote” and a zip file attachment labeled “cancellation_letter_272020508-02242021.zip”.figure 1. qakbot \"signed

of bypassing detection mechanisms that attempt to parse multiple legacy formats inside the spreadsheet. figure 3 below shows a screenshot of output from the open-source xlmmacrodeobfuscator tool, which decodes obfuscated excel 4.0 macros.figure 3. xlmmacrodeobfuscator output for a qakbot excel 4.0 macro spreadsheetonce the excel 4.0 macro is decoded it is possible to see the call to

nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver”. it is also a common tactic for qakbot to execute “regsvr32.exe -s nxckew.wle,dllregisterserver”. both instances are designed to evade sandbox environments that do not supply the expected command line arguments. a representative qakbot dll analyzed by alien labs, 9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28, has two exports: the entry point (0x10005a5d) and dllregisterserver (0x10029c88)and if dllregisterserver is not called via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe with command line options, then only the entry point is called and the malicious code in dllregisterserver is not called. figure 3 below shows improved readability and de-obfuscation of the macro by manually replacing and substituting the cell values and formulas.figure 3. better de-obfuscation of the spreadsheetthe results of our additional de-obfuscation efforts are confirmed when the qakbot excel spreadsheet is run inside a sandbox in figure 4 below.figure 4. otx screenshot showing the “rundll32 ..\\\\nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver\\'\\' executionbefore executing the main payload, the qakbot loader will first test the infected system to see if it is a good candidate for infection. the qakbot loader is responsible for checking its environment to include whether it is running on a virtual machine, identifying any installed and running security and monitoring tools such as antivirus products or common security researcher tools. figure 5 below shows a high-level execution flow of the qakbot loader.figure 5. qakbot execution flowto make detection and analysis harder, qakbot encrypts its strings and decrypts them at runtime before use. once the qakbot execution logic is finished using a string, it will immediately delete the string from memory. an example of this can be seen in figure 6 below, which shows qakbot decrypting a string containing the value for lpprocname passed as a parameter to the getprocaddress api call. the selected function, which has been labeled in ida pro as, “oc_clear_mem” deletes the string memory right after it retrieves the process address.figure 6. qakbot getprocaddress and clear_mem routineswhen executed, qakbot will check whether it has previously been executed on the machine by checking for the specified malware folder. if qakbot discovers it is a first time run, it will relaunch itself from cmd.exe with the /c parameter that will inform the loader to proceed and run its anti-vm checks on the machine and return the results to the parent process. if qakbot detects it is running in a vm environment, then the final payload will not be decrypted since qakbot uses the return value from these checks in its final decryption routine. figure 7 below shows the qakbot environment check logic.figure 7. qakbot environment check logicspecifically, qakbot checks the system for the names of running processes that match the strings listed in table 1 below.process namesfigure 8 below shows the decryption routine for the security and monitoring tool strings (t1140).figure 8. qakbot decrypting tool check stringsqakbot will also add its folder to the windows defender exclusions setting located in the registry (t1112), which prevents defender from scanning qakbot artifacts. the registry location can be seen in figure 9 below.figure 9. qakbot adding exclusion paths to windows defender settingsin addition to the previously mentioned environment check, qakbot collects system information (t1082) such as computer name, system directories, user profiles, and more, which is shown in figure 10 below.figure 10. qakbot system information collectionqakbot will use process hollowing (t1055.012) in order to inject itself into explorer.exe. if it is unsuccessful then qakbot will attempt to inject itself into mobsync.exe or iexplore.exe. the screen shot in figure 11 illustrates the qakbot process name decryption routine.\\xa0figure 11. qakbot routine to decrypt process names for injectionfigure 12 below shows the qakbot logic to overwrite the suspended explorer.exe process and then resume its execution.figure 12. qakbot process hollowing routineadditionally, qakbot abuses the service control manager (scm) to create a child process, which is then detached from the parent when the scm terminates the parent process. qakbot c2 communications begin in this stage to make it more difficult to monitor. figure 13 below shows the scm spawned process abuse technique.figure 13. qakbot abusing scm to spawn a detached processfigure 14 below shows the qakbot c2 ping during the scm interaction.figure 14. qakbot sending c2 pingfinally, if the qakbot loader has verified its execution environment has passed its tests, then qakbot will proceed to decrypt and execute the main qakbot payload, which is hidden as resource “307”. the decryption and import table resolution of its main payload is shown in figure 15 below.figure 15. qakbot decryption and import table resolution of main payloadthe combined anti-analysis and evasion techniques across the infection chain significantly impair antivirus, edr, and other security defenses from detecting and preventing the initial infection. despite the limitations and challenges presented by qakbot dlls there is ample opportunity to detect qakbot loaders signed by revoked and blacklisted malicious certificates. alien labs has identified 42 unique signers and signature serial numbers, which are included in detection methods section to aid in detection and hunting with yara and osquery. additionally, there are a number of behavioral patterns, indicators of behavior (iob), which provide opportunities for detection.alien labs has observed qakbot over the past three months being used in a role similar to trickbot, which includes malspam delivery, stealthy maldocs dropping signed loaders, establishing a foothold, and finally post exploitation activities such as lateral movement, access operations, and ransomware delivery. alien labs actively tracks the qakbot c2 infrastructure for customers, which is available via otx here.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by

which has been previously observed targeting exposed docker infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining purposes and credential theft. the group is using a new detection evasion tool, copied from open source repositories.the purpose of this blog\\xa0is to share new technical intelligence and provide detection and analysis options for defenders.at&t alien labs previously reported on teamtnt cryptomining malware using a new memory loader based on ezuri and written in golang. since then, teamtnt has added another tool to their list of capabilities.the objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.the tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on github, described as \"hide a process under linux using the ld preloader.\\'\\' preloading allows the system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. if the custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the system libraries, the custom version will override it.the tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.the new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the teamtnt cryptominer binary or ircbot (figure 1):figure 1. base64 encoded script, via alien labs analysis.upon binary execution, the bash script will run through a multitude of tasks. specifically, the script will:after decoding, we can observe the bash script functionality and how some malicious activity occurs before the shared library is created (figure 2):figure 2. decoded bash script, via alien labs analysis.the new tool is first dropped as a hidden tar file on disk, the script decompresses it, writes it to \\'/usr/local/lib/systemhealt.so\\', and then adds it preload via \\'/etc/ld.so.preload\\'. this will be used by the system to preload the file before other system libraries, allowing the attacker to override some common functions (figure 3/4).figure 3/4. bash script features, via alien labs analysis.the main purpose of the tool is to hide the teamtnt bot from process viewer tools, which use the file \\'/usr/bin/sbin\\' as you can see in figure 3 and 4 (setup_ircbot function).as final step, the malware will remove traces by deleting bash history:figure 5. bash script cleanup, via alien labs analysis.through the use of libprocesshider, teamtnt once again expands their capabilities based on the available open source tools. while the new functionality of libprocesshider is to evade detection and other basic functions, it acts as an indicator to consider when hunting for malicious activity on the host level. alien labs will continue to monitor the threat and report on any

            "{'titel': 'lazarus campaign ttps and evolution', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs™ has observed new activity that has been attributed to the lazarus adversary group potentially targeting engineering job candidates and/or employees in classified engineering roles within the u.s. and europe. this assessment is based on malicious documents believed to have been delivered by lazarus during the last few months (spring 2021). however, historical analysis shows the lures used in this campaign to be in line with others used to target these groups.the purpose of this blog is to share the new technical intelligence and provide detection options for defenders. alien labs will continue to report on any noteworthy changes.key takeaways:since 2009, the known tools and capabilities believed to have been used by the lazarus group include ddos botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (rats), and drive wiper malware. the most publicly documented malware and tools used by the group actors include destover, duuzer, and hangman.several documents identified from may to june 2021 by twitter users were identified as being linked to the lazarus group. documents observed in previous campaigns lured victims with job opportunities for boeing and bae systems. these new documents include:the documents attempted to impersonate new defense contractors and engineering companies like airbus, general motors (gm), and rheinmetall. all of these documents contain macro malware, which has been developed and improved during the course of this campaign and from one target to another. the core techniques for the three malicious documents are the same, but the attackers attempted to reduce the potential detections and increase the faculties of the macros.the first two documents from early may 2021 were related to a german engineering company focused on the defense and automotive industries, rheinmetall. the second malicious document appears to include more elaborate content, which may have resulted in the documents going unnoticed by victims.the macro has base64 encoded files, which are extracted and decoded during execution. some of the files are split inside the macro and are not combined until the time of decoding. one of the most distinctive characteristics of this macro is how it evades detections of a mz header encoded in base64 (tvoa, tvpb, tvpq, tvqa, tvqq or tvro), by separating the first two characters from the rest of the content, as seen in figure 1.figure 1: concealing of mz header, as captured by alien labs.the rest of the content is kept together in lines of 64 characters, and because of this, yara rules can be used to detect other, typical executable content encoded in base64 aside of the mz header. in this case, up to nine different yara rules alerted to suspicious encoded strings in our alien labs analysis, like virtualprotect, getprocaddress, isdebuggerpresent, getcurrentprocessid, etc.figure 2: yara rules detections listed in the at&t alien labs open threat exchange, otx.all files created by the executable and used by the different macros are located in a new folder c:/drivers with the purpose of masquerading their activity. the macro copies and renames the microsoft legitimate executable certutil.exe into this folder. the reason for this copy is to avoid endpoint detection and response (edr) signatures based on system utilities executed from non-standard sources (a microsoft office document in this case). additionally, the copy of certutil is disguised to avoid using the full string, by partially replacing it with an asterisk %systemroot%\\\\system32\\\\certut*.exe. as seen in later iterations, this technique was slightly modified to further reduce the number of detections.certutil is used to decode the previously mentioned file, doing it within the same folder and with a different executable name. once the necessary files have been decoded, the encoded files are removed from the system.the script queries wmi to list all the explorer.exe processes, where it will try to inject the malicious payload. for the injection, the attackers used mavinject (a legitimate windows component that can be used and abused) to perform arbitrary code injections inside any running process. mavinject.exe has been abused for several years, as indicated in this blog from 2017.figure 3: mavinject injection to explorer, as captured by alien labs.figure 4: malicious document execution tree listed in the at&t alien labs otx.the payload is in fact a downloader, which requests the next stage to a hardcoded command and control (c&c) server and saves it to a new file. this request is made through https with hardcoded headers. in this case, the domain used as c&c has been registered for several years, and the domain continues to have a long expiration date. for these reasons, this domain was assessed as a compromised domain, leveraged by lazarus as c&c.figure 5: hardcoded http headers, as captured by alien labs.a few weeks after the rheinmetall document was observed, a very similar document emerged targeting general motors. the characteristics of this document were very similar to the previous one, but with minor updates in the c&c communication process.after attempting to execute all its code, the macro reports back to the c&c server with the status of the infection. in the code, a variable is updated from 1 to 3, signaling the status of the execution. the c&c is capable of tracking where its execution is failing, or encountering unexpected behavior, based on the requests made to the different documents in the c&c. this includes:the status report to the c&c also requests the lure document, which at this moment is downloaded from the same c&c and opened.figure 6: c&c beacon to report execution status, as captured by alien labs.the domain used in this document and payload allgraphicart[.]com is no longer a compromised domain. it was first registered on april 1, 2021. however, it did not have any noteworthy activity until these malicious documents showed up, at least a month after the domain was registered. the domain was registered with porkbun llc, who offers domains with the free option of protecting the whois information.in early june, a month after the first document of this campaign was observed, a new document was identified targeting airbus. this time, the c&c communications were very similar to the previous iteration of the document; however, the execution and injection processes were different.this document continues utilizing and masquerading certutil, but the copy command had the minor addition of another asterisk to reduce the detection risk: %systemroot%\\\\system32\\\\*ertut*.exe. in addition to certutil, the legitimate explorer executable is copied to the c:\\\\drivers folder through a similar method %systemroot%\\\\exp*.exe. as previously mentioned, these files will be copied and renamed to avoid edr signature-based detections, but this time the destination filenames were carefully chosen. if alphabetically ordered, the first two files will correspond to legitimate software, followed by the malicious files, which could mislead investigators on their first peak on the c:\\\\drivers folder.this macro contains three files encoded with base64 which are copied to disk and decoded during execution:after the actions, the macro executes the mentioned payload with an updated technique. the attackers are no longer using mavinject, but directly executing the payload with explorer.exe, significantly modifying the resulting execution tree as seen in figure 10. once the payload has been executed, the macro waits for three seconds before creating of an .inf file in the same folder. whether it was successfully executed or not, the macro will proceed to send the beacon to the c&c with the execution status and delete all the temporary files, attempting to clean their tracks. the only files left in c:\\\\drivers\\\\ at this point are the payload and the .inf file.figure 7: malicious document execution tree, as captured by at&t alien labs.the new c&c shopweblive[.]com follows the same pattern and characteristics of the one used in the second iteration.the reported activity remains in line with the lazarus’ past campaigns and is not expected to be the last. attack lures, potentially targeting engineering professionals in government organizations, showcase the importance of tracking lazarus and their evolution. we continue to see lazarus using the same tactic, techniques, and procedures that we have observed in the past, such as using microsoft office documents that download remote templates, microsoft office macros, and compromised third party infrastructure to host the payloads and proxy c&c traffic through. at&t alien labs will continue to monitor and report on any noteworthy changes.the following associated detection methods are in use

(by default, the malware will encrypt the current directory and its subfolders.)during execution, the malware will first check if its configuration exists. the configuration file format is very similar to the one observed for revil windows samples, but with fewer fields. some of the fields presented in both versions include:figure 2: hard-coded config file, as captured by alien labs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0figure 3: hard-coded ransom note after decoding, as captured by alien labs.the malware will loop through the target folder, encrypting the files in it. before encryption, it will check to see if the file has already been encrypted by looking at the filename extension.during encryption, the malware will generate a 64 bytes xor key, based on the pk key given in the config file. it will use this key during the encryption process. after encryption, the malware will write the generated key “iv” at the end of each file and leave a ransom note in each folder.figure 4: main encryption routine, as captured by alien labs.figure 5: main encryption routine, as captured by alien labs.the malware will log all the files it goes through, stating if the file was encrypted or if it was unable to encrypt due to os protection.figure 6: encryption logs, as captured by alien labs.figure 7: execution output, as captured by alien labs. .the threat actors behind revil raas have rapidly developed a linux version to compete against the recently released linux version of darkside. it is hard to clarify if these two raas are competing against each other or collaborating team members, as stated by other security researchers. nevertheless, both actors have been very active in the ransomware landscape during the last months, and these upgrades will keep them in the spotlight due to the increased attacking spectrum.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence. a list of indicators is also available in the otx pulse. please note, the pulse may include other activities related but out of the scope of the report.\\xa0typeindicatordescriptionsha256ea1872b2835128e3cb49a0bc27e4727ca33c4e6eba1e80422db19b505f965bc4revil linux samplesha256d6762eff16452434ac1acc127f082906cc1ae5b0ff026d0d4fe725711db47763revil linux samplesha256796800face046765bd79f267c56a6c93ee2800b76d7f38ad96e5acb92599fcd4revil linux samplesha2563d375d0ead2b63168de86ca2649360d9dcff75b3e0ffa2cf1e50816ec92b3b7drevil linux samplethe findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: malware, alien labs, otx pulse, ransomware, security, linux, labs, raas, revilinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",
            "{'titel': 'darkside raas in linux version', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs recently analyzed the linux version of the darkside ransomware, one of the most active ransomware in the last quarter. shortly after hitting colonial pipeline, darkside developers announced they would be closing operations.linux and unix servers have always been a preferred option for servers and data centers, likely due to the small attack surface of the servers, tight configurations, and lack of user interaction. however, they are often set up and then forgotten, left without detection or protection mechanisms. this makes them very attractive to attackers. by infecting unprotected virtualization servers, attackers can perform devastating attacks on companies, taking down all the services of a company with a single infection.first discovered in august 2020, darkside is a group that operates ransomware as a service (raas), and attacks by their network of affiliates have infected many companies worldwide. the most high profile infection happened when a darkside affiliate hit the network of one of the major oil pipeline companies\\xa0in the us, colonial pipeline, causing the company to shut down operations for days. after this attack — likely due to the fact that it drew unwanted levels of attention to the group globally — the malware authors announced publicly the closure of their service. nevertheless, there is evidence that the group has completed a linux version of its malware that is targeting esxi, servers hosting vmware virtual machines. to this point, the authors announced the darkside 2.0 version with linux capabilities on march 9, 2021 in the xss forum:figure 1. example of linux version features and information announced by malware authors on xss forum. \\xa0unlike the windows version of the malware that targets any windows endpoint, darkside linux version is mostly targeting esxi servers. its default configuration includes the root path of esx server machines. \\xa0targeted extensions are 'vmdk', 'log', 'vmem', 'vmsn' that are used in esx servers for saving virtual machines information, data, and logs.the malware is quite informative and prints to the screen most of the actions it performs, which is an uncommon behavior for malware. this could imply that the malware is being deployed manually. the malware is written in c++ and it’s also using several open-source libraries that were imported and compiled with the malware code into one binary. some of these libraries are: crypto++\\xa0used for encryption, boost\\xa0used for logging purposes, and curl\\xa0used for http requests. the use of these libraries enables the final binary to be a 2.7mb file size. for example, to communicate with an infected machine with its command and control (c&c), the malware uses libcurl functions that were compiled with the rest of the code.in addition, the malware supports command line parameters during execution to replace almost, if not all, of the default configuration variables.figure 2. parameters supported by the malware.the malware also supports shutting down virtual machines by executing the esxcli commands, a special console on esx servers that allows it to interact with virtual machines from the command line.figure 3. abusing esxcli command.when executed, the malware prints its configuration to the terminal. this includes the root path to encrypt, rsa key information, targeted file extensions to encrypt, c2 addresses, and more, as seen in figure 4.figure 4. darkside configuration.the c&c addresses are encrypted using a rotated xor key, which will be decrypted when the malware is executed. the decrypted addresses can be found in appendix a:figure 5. decryption loop to extract c&c.figure 6. malware xor key.the malware will then count the files to be encrypted, and it collects information from the infected machine, sending it to the c&c server after encryption. the exfiltrated information includes: user name, os version, hostname, build, and more:figure 7. collecting system information.figure 8 shows an example of the information collected from an infected machine.figure 8. example of collected system information.the malware will loop through the files to be encrypted and then encrypt them using chacha20 with the rsa 4096 key taken from the configuration. after encryption, the malware will add a tail at the end of the encrypted file that includes a constant and the cipher, as seen in figure 9.figure 9. adding header after successful encryptionafter encryption, the malware creates a ransom note in each folder where files were encrypted.figure 10. ransom noteransomwares remains one of the biggest threats to companies globally, especially when it comes to virtual machine servers that may contain multiple machines that are primary targets for darkside malware.darkside will search files on the main folder of the infected server and encrypt any file that matches its configuration limits. it will also collect information from the system and send it to its c&c.the following associated detection methods are in use by at&t

            "{'titel': 'malware hosting domain cyberium fanning out mirai variants', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs has observed the mirai variant botnet, known as moobot, scanning for known but uncommon vulnerabilities in tenda routers, resulting in a considerable peak in our internal telemetry. the research associated with this peak resulted in the discovery of a malware hosting domain, providing several different mirai variants, like moobot and satori.key points:during the end of march, at&t alien labs observed a spike in exploitation attempts for tenda remote code execution (rce) vulnerability cve-2020-10987. this spike was observed throughout a significant number of clients, in the space of a few hours. this vulnerability is not commonly used by web scanners and was barely detected by our honeypots during the last six months, except for a minor peak in november.this exploit can be identified by the url that is requested, which includes ‘setusbunload’ with the payload assigned to the vulnerable parameter ‘devicename’. this payload contains the logic to change the execution path to a temporary location, wget a file from a malware hosting page, provide execution permissions, and execute it.figure 1. binaryedge sensor detecting the vulnerability scan.following this thread, a single actor was identified to be behind these scans in late march — at the time, the actor appeared to have no previous activity. the scan for tenda vulnerable routers only lasted one day, but the scanning activity continued for several weeks, including the below vulnerabilities:some of these exploit attempts were captured by honeypots. all of them appeared to be pulling their next iteration of the malware from the same malware hosting page: dns.cyberium[.]cc.when this domain was investigated, several campaigns were identified, going back at least one year to may 2020. most of the attacks lasted for approximately a week while they hosted several mirai variants, after which they left the subdomain unresolvable. however, this seems to be the behavior of the threat actor in between operations. the actors appear to come back to the same domain with a new subdomain for each new campaign. activity in between campaigns goes quiet to increase the trust of the original domain. keeping a long-running existing domain while issuing brand new one domain helps to divert attention to the new domain and thus distract from the original.figure 2. riskiq heatmap of cyberium[.]cc.the full list of subdomains/campaigns identified from this domain is:we were able to identify other infrastructure that we assess with high confidence is controlled by the same actor and has been used as moobot command and control in the past.all of the domains use the same:the first request to these malware hosting pages was for a bash script, which aimed to download later stages of the malware. as seen in the screenshot below, the script attempts to download a list of filenames (associated with different cpu architectures), executes each one of them, achieves persistence through a crontab that redownloads the bash script itself, and finally deletes itself.figure 3. tenda downloader script.this script is very similar to downloaders previously seen for mirai variants. the minor modifications appear to be on the downloading server, persistence methods (if any) and the filename, usually named after the vulnerable device vendor.during the time this domain was available and delivering malware, at least three different variants of mirai were identified: moobot, satori/fbot, and other samples unassociated with these botnets. one of the peculiarities of this domain was how it juggled between mirai variants, even under the same filenames. the same url could be hosting satori one day and moobot the week after.in october 2020, lacework\\xa0reported on a new mirai variant called moobot. this variant mainly chased exposed and vulnerable dockers apis to include them into their ddos botnet. one of the main distinctions of this variant has been a hardcoded string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, compared to the mirai source code which used the string “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw012345678” as a seed to generate an alphanumeric string. this random string is used several times throughout the code, one of them to generate the process name to be used during execution.many samples available at cyberium contained the above-mentioned string and this domain was already being used to distribute this botnet when lacework first reported on it. however, the number of samples alien labs has seen with that string has greatly increased in the last months, scattering from the original moobot sample. this could potentially mean that last year\\'s moobots samples were used to create new branches of mirai variants.unlike some other mirai variants, the samples obtained from moobot were encrypted, attempting to evade string-based detection, static analysis of the exploits used, or after compromised activities. however, it did maintain other previously seen characteristics, like a hardcoded list of ip addresses\\xa0to avoid, such as: private ranges, the department of defense, iana ips, ge, hp and others.figure 4. moobot’s ip scan restrictions.the malware writers appear to be very aware of who they’re potential victims are. for this reason, the malware will try to hide its process name by changing it using prctl. the covert process name is “/var/sofia”, which is the name of a video application on the targeted devices.figure 5. moobot process hideout.right after hiding the process, this sample will print to screen the string “9xsspnvgc8aj5pi7m28p” which has been associated with different mirai variants over time (fbot\\xa0and gafgyt). however, it appears this is a passed down characteristic through variant versions, like previously seen with “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, but this time there aren’t any shared iocs with previous attackers.after successful infection, the payload attempts to query the hardcoded c2 on port 12028 to get a list of c2. at the time of study, the cyberium domain was down, and these communications couldn’t be analyzed.early in march 2021, the same links previously mentioned for moobot, for example dns.cyberium[.]cc/arm, were actually providing samples for satori. the satori botnet, also known as fbot, is yet another mirai variant based botnet. unexpectedly, these samples were mingled with other unix botnets in the same malware hosting server.the similarities between moobot and satori samples are vast, since they both are coming from the same mirai source code. these similarities include:the most noteworthy differences observed were:additional samples were identified under the same domain, which on a first investigation appeared to be a mix between the already mentioned moobot and satori samples with a random combination of their characteristics. most of them looked like moobot samples without the encoding or satori without the hardcoded domain.however, the samples are not associated with the current domain under study, probably because it is being left fallow. after pivoting on the scanning ip, delivering the downloaders scripts, it is currently providing the same script with an updated temporary domain, which is currently delivering additional satori/fbot samples packed with upx.alien labs has identified the cyberium malware hosting domain to be providing many different mirai variants, like moobot or satori, during the last year. actors have been jumping between subdomains to recycle their infrastructure as most as possible. at the time of publishing this blog (may 2021) some of the cyberium subdomains were up, but they were not hosting any malware samples. they could be potentially awaiting new requests for c2 lists.several questions remain unanswered. why would the attackers deliver different mirai variants with different c2s on the same campaign? and, are they trying to avoid anti-virus detection through diversification of variants? or, are they trying to improve the botnet resiliency by diversifying c2.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.suricata ids signaturesalert http $external_net any -> $home_net any (msg:\"av exploit tenda router rce (cve-2020-10987)\"; flow:to_server,established;

as if the activity was happening in a traditional environment.endpoint denial of service (t1499): adversaries may perform endpoint dos attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. this blockage could be used as an additional impact on top of data encrypted for impact (t1486) to avoid or slow down\\xa0recovery efforts in a ransomware attack. in this scenario, attackers could be trying to block access to several aws resources like: s3, ec2 through efs or ebs, or backups between others.s3: amazon’s storage service can suffer a dos by adding policies that block access to its contents. buckets and access points are both s3 resources that could be impacted by an excessively restrictive policy or access control list (acl), hence their relevance.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:denyaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)additionally, the events deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicy would have a similar effect, since they would be removing the policies where the public access is allowed.detection guidance:event/command:deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicyguardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)in a similar situation, amazon’s elastic file system (efs): any policy change denying access to this storage solution\\xa0could also lead to a dos. due to this, these\\xa0events and resource policies should be closely observed.detection guidance:event/commandputfilesystempolicyeffectdenyactionelasticfilesystem:clientmount or elasticfilesystem:clientwriteguardduty alert-indicator removal on host (t1070): adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files, such as quarantined malware. in this case, removed indicators not only affect the host, but the whole cloud and the log ingestion platform in charge of generating alerts. the main affected resource is cloudwatch, but there are others too.cloudwatch is\\xa0the monitoring service for aws resources\\xa0tracks logs coming from different resources and accounts in aws. blocking the logging access to resources would have a similar effect as deleting logs in a traditional computer.putresourcepolicy gives permission for other aws services to put log events to the current account. a new policy with effect deny on all\\xa0could avoid resources logging on their expected log file, and delay alerting on a detection. additionally, putdestinationpolicy has a similar\\xa0behavior - it has the capability of creating an access policy for existing log destinations. a restrictive policy could lead to a logs not being in the expected log location. in this case, putresourcepolicy api or cli does not allow specifying * as the principal, and each sender account must be listed separately in the policy.several guardduty finding types could notify of any policy log tampering that could impact detection of indicators.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicy or putdestinationpolicyeffect:denyaction:logs:*guardduty alert:stealth:s3/serveraccessloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/cloudtrailloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/loggingconfigurationmodifiedother log events could be of relevance, like putretentionpolicy, but none of their effects would be as drastic as the previously mentioned or are not strictly determined by policies.inhibit system recovery (t1490): blocking access to the backups or modifying permissions to delete them, most likely with ransomware intentions.efs offers an automatic backup system through the command putbackuppolicy, which could be disabled in a ransomware scenario causing slower recovery efforts.detection guidance:event/command:putbackuppolicystatus:disabledbackups: aws offers several solutions for backing up systems (as we have already seen with the efs solution). looking into the aws backup official solution and disabling it or removing permissions to access them has the direct impact of a dos, and aggravates the ransomware scenario.detection guidance:event/command:putbackupvaultaccesspolicyeffect:denyallowaction:backup:*backup:delete*guardduty alert:-exfiltration over web service (t1567): exposes current resources to the internet with the intention of exfiltrating data outside of the organization.s3: as we saw in the dos section, a change in policies could remove public internet access to a bucket or access point. in this situation we are looking at the opposite scenario, a private s3 being made public to leverage it for exfiltration purposes.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:allowaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/bucketpublicaccessgranted or policy:s3/bucketanonymousaccessgrantedelasticsearch: if the domain associated with an elasticsearch instance is public, an attacker could modify any existing condition, like ip addresses\\xa0or command restrictions - to increase the actions that can be performed on this public domain. aws does not have a specific command to modify its access policies for elasticsearch, but they can be modified from the user interface or the api through the domain config, on an individual domain basis.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:es:* (in particular es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig)guardduty alert:-attackers could also create a new elasticsearch domain and include the above-mentioned policies. it is outside the scope of this blog to discuss\\xa0operations involving new resources to exfiltrate data (elasticsearch, s3, efs, etc.). this attack would become noisier, since it involves creating new resources, applying the mentioned policies, and copying any relevant data to these resources. just for reference, this attack would classify as transfer data to cloud account (t1537).elastic container registry (ecr): provides the capability to store docker containers and have them ready for deployment. this deployment availability can also be turned around and be used for exfiltration by\\xa0downloading docker containers from a pre-signed amazon s3 download url. this privilege can be obtained by modifying the setrepositorypolicy for the corresponding ecr and allowing the action getdownloadurlforlayer to access it externally.detection guidance:event/command:setrepositorypolicy or putrepositorypolicyeffect:allowaction:ecr:getdownloadurlforlayerguardduty alert:-os credential dumping (t1003): uses a lack of security to dump credentials either encrypted, hashed or in clear text, to use them later in towards lateral movement or accessing confidential information.aws secrets manager is a great example of a target for a credential access scenario. the secrets in this vault need to be accessed by internal or external resources eventually, and a bad security policy might allow an attacker to take those credentials. these might be encrypted with a kms key, but attackers would still be one step closer to their their goal.an escalation of privileges (or decrease in security) could be achieved through the putresourcepolicy for secretsmanager. an excess of allowed privileges could make credential access easier.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:secretsmanager:* (in particular getsecretvalue)guardduty alert:-aws key management service (kms): is amazon’s key manager to control what users and applications have access to certain cryptographic keys. access to these keys is, as you can expect at this point of the blog, given by a specific policy. changes made to this policy can enable\\xa0several different attacks (like a dos if access is denied to all users), but in this case we are looking at a too permissive policy set with putkeypolicy.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:kms:putkeypolicyguardduty alert:-in addition to the already mentioned events and aws resources, there are others that could be leveraged by attackers, but these fall out of the scope of this blog to keep it a\\xa0reasonable length. just to mention some of these - they would be: amazon simple queue service (sqs) through sqs:addpermission, amazon simple notification service (amazon sns) through sns:addpermission, aws elemental mediastore through putcontainerpolicy, aws lambda through lambda:addpermission, etc.after analyzing some of the most relevant policy changes impacting the cloud environment’s security in your organization, we’ll take a look at some of the aws penetration testing tools available for free, and how they use\\xa0policies.aws offers an access analyzer capable of assessing existing resource-based policies, and focuses on identifying any resources shared with external entities. amazon refers to an external entity as any other aws account, root user, iam user or role, federated user, aws service, anonymous user, or other entity.it is a great resource for some critical resources like s3, kms or secretmanager. however, it lacks coverage to other resources that could be as important, like elasticsearch domains or cloudwatch resource policies.this free cloud pentesting tool provides a deep test of existing policies in aws. the only prerequisite is an aws api credential with privileges to update resource policies. it is capable of running in ‘expose’ mode, modifying just the necessary resources to achieve a backdoor, or ‘smash’ mode, revealing potential security concerns by: enumerating resources, reading and modifying current policies, and finally implanting as many backdoors as possible through weaknesses in the victim’s iam security policies.it offers approximately 30% more coverage than aws iam access analyzer, including coverage for:in the full list of policies required to achieve all the backdoors included with the tool, we can see some policies already mentioned in this blog: ecr:setrepositorypolicy, elasticfilesystem:putfilesystempolicy, es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig, kms:putkeypolicy, lambda:addpermission, logs:putresourcepolicy, s3:putbucketpolicy, secretsmanager:putresourcepolicy.cloudsplaining performs a deep assessment on all the aws iam security policies and identifies violations of least privilege, producing a full html report. the report includes triage items as well as remediation indications, offering the user a very helpful resource to analyze their current configuration and offering improvement possibilities.hacking the cloud is an online encyclopedia supported by volunteers. the webpage contains a list of attacks/tactics/techniques that offensive security professionals can use to pentest their cloud environments. the attacks are not very policy focused, but it does use them in some attacks, like in the “unauthenticated enumeration of iam users and roles”, which is present in pacu too.there are many other open source useful tools for cloud pentesting or policy assessment, like: parliament, pacu, pmapper, repokid, policy sentry.in this blog we have seen several attacks\\xa0that\\xa0could be performed using aws policies - especially if they weren’t properly set up. we've discussed\\xa0the\\xa0importance of aws policies as the foundation of a good cloud security. we have seen how guardduty detects some dangerous policy changes, but leaves out many others that can only be detected through constantly reviewing\\xa0cloudtrail logs. the pentesting tools seen in the blog can help detect holes in the policies. an alternative solution is the use of siems like usm anywhere, with specific detection rules added on a daily basis, thanks to the threat content that the at&t alien labs team adds to the usm anywhere platform.aws policies: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/latest/userguide/access_policies.htmlendgame: https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latestcloudsplaining: https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaininghacking the cloud: https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/connection-tracking/parliament: https://github.com/duo-labs/parliamentpacu: https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/pacu-open-source-aws-exploitation-framework/pmapper: https://github.com/nccgroup/pmapperrepokid: https://github.com/netflix/repokidpolicy sentry: https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry/the findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: ransomware, cloud security, attacks, labs, iam, aws security, open source, aws policyinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.\"}\n",
            "{'titel': 'the rise of qakbot', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was jointly written with ofer caspi. some of the links in this blog require an otx account, and the qakbot infrastructure tracker will require readers to be customers with access to the threat intel subscription.. thanks to the following researchers and the malwarebazaar project:at&t alien labs closely monitors the evolution of crimeware such as the qakbot\\xa0(also known as qbot) malware family and campaigns in connection with qakbot. the jointly coordinated takedown of the actors behind emotet in late january has left a gap in the cybercrime landscape, which qakbot seems poised to fill.key points:qakbot, also known as qbot or pinkslipbot, is a modular information stealer. it has been active since 2007 and primarily used by financially motivated actors. it was initially known as a banking trojan and a loader using c2 servers for payload delivery; however, its use expanded beyond strictly being a banking trojan. the hallmarks of a qakbot infection chain consist of a phishing lure (t1566) delivered via email chain hijacking or spoofed emails that contain context-aware information such as shipping, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, claims, etc. the phishing emails alternate between file attachments (t1566.001) and links (t1566.002). qakbot is often used as a gateway entry, similar to trickbot or emotet, that leads to post exploitation operations leveraging frameworks such as cobalt strike as well as delivering ransomware.qakbot email lures are not the most sophisticated; however, by using contextually aware themes that originate from hijacked email chains or potentially compromised accounts within a user’s social circle, they are effective. figure 1 below illustrates an example of a recent qakbot lure with the subject “re: signed quote” and a zip file attachment labeled “cancellation_letter_272020508-02242021.zip”.figure 1. qakbot \"signed quote\" email lurethe actors further establish the trust and confidence of the targeted user by presenting a semi-official looking docusign graphic that guides the user through the process of enabling the excel 4 macros. a representative sample, 78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a, seen in a recent qakbot campaign is shown in figure 2 below.figure 2. qakbot docusign lureqakbot excel spreadsheets often contain hidden spreadsheets, excel 4.0 macros, spreadsheet formulas, and biff records all designed to pass a visual inspection from the user with the added benefit of bypassing detection mechanisms that attempt to parse multiple legacy formats inside the spreadsheet. figure 3 below shows a screenshot of output from the open-source xlmmacrodeobfuscator tool, which decodes obfuscated excel 4.0 macros.figure 3. xlmmacrodeobfuscator output for a qakbot excel 4.0 macro spreadsheetonce the excel 4.0 macro is decoded it is possible to see the call to urldownloadtofilea, which downloads the qakbot dll in this campaign from http[:]//rlyrt26rnxw02vqijgs[.]com/fera/frid[.]gif. next, the exec function is evaluated which executes “rundll32.exe nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver”. it is also a common tactic for qakbot to execute “regsvr32.exe -s nxckew.wle,dllregisterserver”. both instances are designed to evade sandbox environments that do not supply the expected command line arguments. a representative qakbot dll analyzed by alien labs, 9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28, has two exports: the entry point (0x10005a5d) and dllregisterserver (0x10029c88)and if dllregisterserver is not called via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe with command line options, then only the entry point is called and the malicious code in dllregisterserver is not called. figure 3 below shows improved readability and de-obfuscation of the macro by manually replacing and substituting the cell values and formulas.figure 3. better de-obfuscation of the spreadsheetthe results of our additional de-obfuscation efforts are confirmed when the qakbot excel spreadsheet is run inside a sandbox in figure 4 below.figure 4. otx screenshot showing the “rundll32 ..\\\\nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver\\'\\' executionbefore executing the main payload, the qakbot loader will first test the infected system to see if it is a good candidate for infection. the qakbot loader is responsible for checking its environment to include whether it is running on a virtual machine, identifying any installed and running security and monitoring tools such as antivirus products or common security researcher tools. figure 5 below shows a high-level execution flow of the qakbot loader.figure 5. qakbot execution flowto make detection and analysis harder, qakbot encrypts its strings and decrypts them at runtime before use. once the qakbot execution logic is finished using a string, it will immediately delete the string from memory. an example of this can be seen in figure 6 below, which shows qakbot decrypting a string containing the value for lpprocname passed as a parameter to the getprocaddress api call. the selected function, which has been labeled in ida pro as, “oc_clear_mem” deletes the string memory right after it retrieves the process address.figure 6. qakbot getprocaddress and clear_mem routineswhen executed, qakbot will check whether it has previously been executed on the machine by checking for the specified malware folder. if qakbot discovers it is a first time run, it will relaunch itself from cmd.exe with the /c parameter that will inform the loader to proceed and run its anti-vm checks on the machine and return the results to the parent process. if qakbot detects it is running in a vm environment, then the final payload will not be decrypted since qakbot uses the return value from these checks in its final decryption routine. figure 7 below shows the qakbot environment check logic.figure 7. qakbot environment check logicspecifically, qakbot checks the system for the names of running processes that match the strings listed in table 1 below.process namesfigure 8 below shows the decryption routine for the security and monitoring tool strings (t1140).figure 8. qakbot decrypting tool check stringsqakbot will also add its folder to the windows defender exclusions setting located in the registry (t1112), which prevents defender from scanning qakbot artifacts. the registry location can be seen in figure 9 below.figure 9. qakbot adding exclusion paths to windows defender settingsin addition to the previously mentioned environment check, qakbot collects system information (t1082) such as computer name, system directories, user profiles, and more, which is shown in figure 10 below.figure 10. qakbot system information collectionqakbot will use process hollowing (t1055.012) in order to inject itself into explorer.exe. if it is unsuccessful then qakbot will attempt to inject itself into mobsync.exe or iexplore.exe. the screen shot in figure 11 illustrates the qakbot process name decryption routine.\\xa0figure 11. qakbot routine to decrypt process names for injectionfigure 12 below shows the qakbot logic to overwrite the suspended explorer.exe process and then resume its execution.figure 12. qakbot process hollowing routineadditionally, qakbot abuses the service control manager (scm) to create a child process, which is then detached from the parent when the scm terminates the parent process. qakbot c2 communications begin in this stage to make it more difficult to monitor. figure 13 below shows the scm spawned process abuse technique.figure 13. qakbot abusing scm to spawn a detached processfigure 14 below shows the qakbot c2 ping during the scm interaction.figure 14. qakbot sending c2 pingfinally, if the qakbot loader has verified its execution environment has passed its tests, then qakbot will proceed to decrypt and execute the main qakbot payload, which is hidden as resource “307”. the decryption and import table resolution of its main payload is shown in figure 15 below.figure 15. qakbot decryption and import table resolution of main payloadthe combined anti-analysis and evasion techniques across the infection chain significantly impair antivirus, edr, and other security defenses from detecting and preventing the initial infection. despite the limitations and challenges presented by qakbot dlls there is ample opportunity to detect qakbot loaders signed by revoked and blacklisted malicious certificates. alien labs has identified 42 unique signers and signature serial numbers, which are included in detection methods section to aid in detection and hunting with yara and osquery. additionally, there are a number of behavioral patterns, indicators of behavior (iob), which provide opportunities for detection.alien labs has observed qakbot over the past three months being used in a role similar to trickbot, which includes malspam delivery, stealthy maldocs dropping signed loaders, establishing a foothold, and finally post exploitation activities such as lateral movement, access operations, and ransomware delivery. alien labs actively tracks the qakbot c2 infrastructure for customers, which is available via otx here.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by defenders to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.agent signatures\\xa0the following technical indicators are associated with the reported

which has been previously observed targeting exposed docker infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining purposes and credential theft. the group is using a new detection evasion tool, copied from open source repositories.the purpose of this blog\\xa0is to share new technical intelligence and provide detection and analysis options for defenders.at&t alien labs previously reported on teamtnt cryptomining malware using a new memory loader based on ezuri and written in golang. since then, teamtnt has added another tool to their list of capabilities.the objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.the tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on github, described as \"hide a process under linux using the ld preloader.\\'\\' preloading allows the system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. if the custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the system libraries, the custom version will override it.the tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.the new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the teamtnt cryptominer binary or ircbot (figure 1):figure 1. base64 encoded script, via alien labs analysis.upon binary execution, the bash script will run through a multitude of tasks. specifically, the script will:after decoding, we can observe the bash script functionality and how some malicious activity occurs before the shared library is created (figure 2):figure 2. decoded bash script, via alien labs analysis.the new tool is first dropped as a hidden tar file on disk, the script decompresses it, writes it to \\'/usr/local/lib/systemhealt.so\\', and then adds it preload via \\'/etc/ld.so.preload\\'. this will be used by the system to preload the file before other system libraries, allowing the attacker to override some common functions (figure 3/4).figure 3/4. bash script features, via alien labs analysis.the main purpose of the tool is to hide the teamtnt bot from process viewer tools, which use the file \\'/usr/bin/sbin\\' as you can see in figure 3 and 4 (setup_ircbot function).as final step, the malware will remove traces by deleting bash history:figure 5. bash script cleanup, via alien labs analysis.through the use of libprocesshider, teamtnt once again expands their capabilities based on the available open source tools. while the new functionality of libprocesshider is to evade detection and other basic functions, it acts as an indicator to consider when hunting for malicious activity on the host level. alien labs will continue to monitor the threat and report on any

            "{'titel': 'malware using new ezuri memory loader', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was written by ofer caspi and fernando martinez of at&t alien labsmultiple threat actors have recently started using a go language (golang) tool to act as a packer and avoid antivirus detection. additionally, the ezuri memory loader tool acts as a malware loader and executes its payload in memory, without writing the file to disk. while this technique is known and commonly used by windows malware, it is less popular in linux environments. the loader decrypts the malicious malware and executes it using memfd create (as described in this blog in 2018). when creating a process, the system returns a file descriptor to an anonymous file in \\'/proc/pid/fd/\\' which is visible only in the filesystem.figure 1 shows a code snippet from the loader, containing the information it uses in order to decrypt the payload using the aes algorithm. figure 1. loader code snippet via alien labs analysis.the loader, written in golang, is taken from the \"ezuri\" code on github via the user guitmz. this user originally created the elf loader around march 2019, when he wrote a blog about the technique to run elf executables from memory and shared the loader on his github. additionally, a similar user ‘tmz’ (presumably associated with the previously mentioned ‘guitmz’) posted this same code in late august, on a small forum where malware samples are shared.the guitmz user even ran tests against virustotal to prove the efficiency of the code, uploading a detected linux.cephei sample (35308b8b770d2d4f78299262f595a0769e55152cb432d0efc42292db01609a18) with 30/61 av detections in virustotal, compared to the zero av detections by the same sample hidden with the ezuri code (ddbb714157f2ef91c1ec350cdf1d1f545290967f61491404c81b4e6e52f5c41f).the execution flow of the loader is to first decrypt the payload and then execute it from memory (figure 2):figure 2. execution flow, retrieved from alien labs analysis.guitmz gave this sample the name ezuri, probably after the card with the same name from the card game “magic: the gathering.” \\xa0this card has the capability to “regenerate another target elf,” reflecting the \\xa0malware’s capability of loading and executing an elf file in memory.at&t alien labs team accessed guitmz’s upload of code for analysis. the tool is written in golang and is intuitive to use. when executing, it first asks the path for the payload to be encrypted, along with the password to be used for aes encryption. if no password is given, the tool generates one, which is used to hide the malware within the loader. after the user\\'s input, the packer compiles the loader with the payload encrypted within it, so it can be decrypted and executed in memory once it is placed in the victim’s system. figure 4 shows the main function of the executable, where the file is first decrypted by “aesdec” to then be run in memory by “runfrommemory”. figure 3 shows ezuri main function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.figure 4 shows the “runfrommemory” function used to execute the payload in memory without placing the detectable malware on disk.figure 4 shows ezuri runfrommemory function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.to use the tool, the user will be requested to enter the file to be hidden, with a target process name as well as an optional aes key for encryption (figure 5):figure 5 shows ezuri execution, retrieved from alien labs analysis.at&t alien labs has identified several malware authors leveraging the ezuri loader in the last few months, including teamtnt, which was the first identified. teamtnt is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least april 2020, when the security firm trend micro first reported on them. the main focus of the group is to target docker systems with misconfigurations, as well as unprotected and exposed management apis, to later install ddos bots and cryptominers in the infected systems. a few months after the trend micro report, in august 2020, cado security found new developments in the teamtnt group. in october 2020, palo alto networks unit42 identified new variants of the cryptomining malware used by teamtnt named “black-t.” this sample first installs three network scanners, and then inspects memory in an attempt to retrieve any type of credentials located in the memory. additionally, unit42 identified several german-language strings in some of the tnt scripts.the last sample identified by palo alto networks unit42 is actually an ezuri loader. the decrypted payload is an elf file packed with upx, which is a known sample from teamtnt, first seen in june 2020 (e15550481e89dbd154b875ce50cc5af4b49f9ff7b837d9ac5b5594e5d63966a3).the techniques and code similarities between the original tool, named ezuri, and the one recently used by teamtnt are vast. the most evident one being the \\'ezuri\\' string in the compiled binary (figure 6):figure 6 shows ezuri string in teamtnt\\xa0sample retrieved from alien labs analysis.using this packer, the antivirus (av) detection drops dramatically. looking at the teamtnt malware detections before using ezuri packer (b494ca3b7bae2ab9a5197b81e928baae5b8eac77dfdc7fe1223fee8f27024772), we see 28/62 av detections of the malware, while the ezuri packed version (751014e0154d219dea8c2e999714c32fd98f817782588cd7af355d2488eb1c80) drops to only 3/64 av detections.in addition to teamtnt, there were several gafgyt samples observed (popular iot device malware with ddos attacks purposes). several malware authors have been using an open source golang tool to act as a malware loader, using a known technique to load the elf binaries into memory and avoid using easy-to-detect files on disk. the authors use the open source tool ezuri, to load its previously seen payloads and avoid antivirus detections on the file. the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe

(by default, the malware will encrypt the current directory and its subfolders.)during execution, the malware will first check if its configuration exists. the configuration file format is very similar to the one observed for revil windows samples, but with fewer fields. some of the fields presented in both versions include:figure 2: hard-coded config file, as captured by alien labs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0figure 3: hard-coded ransom note after decoding, as captured by alien labs.the malware will loop through the target folder, encrypting the files in it. before encryption, it will check to see if the file has already been encrypted by looking at the filename extension.during encryption, the malware will generate a 64 bytes xor key, based on the pk key given in the config file. it will use this key during the encryption process. after encryption, the malware will write the generated key “iv” at the end of each file and leave a ransom note in each folder.figure 4: main encryption routine, as captured by alien labs.figure 5: main encryption routine, as captured by alien labs.the malware will log all the files it goes through, stating if the file was encrypted or if it was unable to encrypt due to os protection.figure 6: encryption logs, as captured by alien labs.figure 7: execution output, as captured by alien labs. .the threat actors behind revil raas have rapidly developed a linux version to compete against the recently released linux version of darkside. it is hard to clarify if these two raas are competing against each other or collaborating team members, as stated by other security researchers. nevertheless, both actors have been very active in the ransomware landscape during the last months, and these upgrades will keep them in the spotlight due to the increased attacking spectrum.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence. a list of indicators is also available in the otx pulse. please note, the pulse may include other activities related but out of the scope of the report.\\xa0typeindicatordescriptionsha256ea1872b2835128e3cb49a0bc27e4727ca33c4e6eba1e80422db19b505f965bc4revil linux samplesha256d6762eff16452434ac1acc127f082906cc1ae5b0ff026d0d4fe725711db47763revil linux samplesha256796800face046765bd79f267c56a6c93ee2800b76d7f38ad96e5acb92599fcd4revil linux samplesha2563d375d0ead2b63168de86ca2649360d9dcff75b3e0ffa2cf1e50816ec92b3b7drevil linux samplethe findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: malware, alien labs, otx pulse, ransomware, security, linux, labs, raas, revilinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",
            "{'titel': 'darkside raas in linux version', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs recently analyzed the linux version of the darkside ransomware, one of the most active ransomware in the last quarter. shortly after hitting colonial pipeline, darkside developers announced they would be closing operations.linux and unix servers have always been a preferred option for servers and data centers, likely due to the small attack surface of the servers, tight configurations, and lack of user interaction. however, they are often set up and then forgotten, left without detection or protection mechanisms. this makes them very attractive to attackers. by infecting unprotected virtualization servers, attackers can perform devastating attacks on companies, taking down all the services of a company with a single infection.first discovered in august 2020, darkside is a group that operates ransomware as a service (raas), and attacks by their network of affiliates have infected many companies worldwide. the most high profile infection happened when a darkside affiliate hit the network of one of the major oil pipeline companies\\xa0in the us, colonial pipeline, causing the company to shut down operations for days. after this attack — likely due to the fact that it drew unwanted levels of attention to the group globally — the malware authors announced publicly the closure of their service. nevertheless, there is evidence that the group has completed a linux version of its malware that is targeting esxi, servers hosting vmware virtual machines. to this point, the authors announced the darkside 2.0 version with linux capabilities on march 9, 2021 in the xss forum:figure 1. example of linux version features and information announced by malware authors on xss forum. \\xa0unlike the windows version of the malware that targets any windows endpoint, darkside linux version is mostly targeting esxi servers. its default configuration includes the root path of esx server machines. \\xa0targeted extensions are 'vmdk', 'log', 'vmem', 'vmsn' that are used in esx servers for saving virtual machines information, data, and logs.the malware is quite informative and prints to the screen most of the actions it performs, which is an uncommon behavior for malware. this could imply that the malware is being deployed manually. the malware is written in c++ and it’s also using several open-source libraries that were imported and compiled with the malware code into one binary. some of these libraries are: crypto++\\xa0used for encryption, boost\\xa0used for logging purposes, and curl\\xa0used for http requests. the use of these libraries enables the final binary to be a 2.7mb file size. for example, to communicate with an infected machine with its command and control (c&c), the malware uses libcurl functions that were compiled with the rest of the code.in addition, the malware supports command line parameters during execution to replace almost, if not all, of the default configuration variables.figure 2. parameters supported by the malware.the malware also supports shutting down virtual machines by executing the esxcli commands, a special console on esx servers that allows it to interact with virtual machines from the command line.figure 3. abusing esxcli command.when executed, the malware prints its configuration to the terminal. this includes the root path to encrypt, rsa key information, targeted file extensions to encrypt, c2 addresses, and more, as seen in figure 4.figure 4. darkside

            "{'titel': 'malware hosting domain cyberium fanning out mirai variants', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs has observed the mirai variant botnet, known as moobot, scanning for known but uncommon vulnerabilities in tenda routers, resulting in a considerable peak in our internal telemetry. the research associated with this peak resulted in the discovery of a malware hosting domain, providing several different mirai variants, like moobot and satori.key points:during the end of march, at&t alien labs observed a spike in exploitation attempts for tenda remote code execution (rce) vulnerability cve-2020-10987. this spike was observed throughout a significant number of clients, in the space of a few hours. this vulnerability is not commonly used by web scanners and was barely detected by our honeypots during the last six months, except for a minor peak in november.this exploit can be identified by the url that is requested, which includes ‘setusbunload’ with the payload assigned to the vulnerable parameter ‘devicename’. this payload contains the logic to change the execution path to a temporary location, wget a file from a malware hosting page, provide execution permissions, and execute it.figure 1. binaryedge sensor detecting the vulnerability scan.following this thread, a single actor was identified to be behind these scans in late march — at the time, the actor appeared to have no previous activity. the scan for tenda vulnerable routers only lasted one day, but the scanning activity continued for several weeks, including the below vulnerabilities:some of these exploit attempts were captured by honeypots. all of them appeared to be pulling their next iteration of the malware from the same malware hosting page: dns.cyberium[.]cc.when this domain was investigated, several campaigns were identified, going back at least one year to may 2020. most of the attacks lasted for approximately a week while they hosted several mirai variants, after which they left the subdomain unresolvable. however, this seems to be the behavior of the threat actor in between operations. the actors appear to come back to the same domain with a new subdomain for each new campaign. activity in between campaigns goes quiet to increase the trust of the original domain. keeping a long-running existing domain while issuing brand new one domain helps to divert attention to the new domain and thus distract from the original.figure 2. riskiq heatmap of cyberium[.]cc.the full list of subdomains/campaigns identified from this domain is:we were able to identify other infrastructure that we assess with high confidence is controlled by the same actor and has been used as moobot command and control in the past.all of the domains use the same:the first request to these malware hosting pages was for a bash script, which aimed to download later stages of the malware. as seen in the screenshot below, the script attempts to download a list of filenames (associated with different cpu architectures), executes each one of them, achieves persistence through a crontab that redownloads the bash script itself, and finally deletes itself.figure 3. tenda downloader script.this script is very similar to downloaders previously seen for mirai variants. the minor modifications appear to be on the downloading server, persistence methods (if any) and the filename, usually named after the vulnerable device vendor.during the time this domain was available and delivering malware, at least three different variants of mirai were identified: moobot, satori/fbot, and other samples unassociated with these botnets. one of the peculiarities of this domain was how it juggled between mirai variants, even under the same filenames. the same url could be hosting satori one day and moobot the week after.in october 2020, lacework\\xa0reported on a new mirai variant called moobot. this variant mainly chased exposed and vulnerable dockers apis to include them into their ddos botnet. one of the main distinctions of this variant has been a hardcoded string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, compared to the mirai source code which used the string “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw012345678” as a seed to generate an alphanumeric string. this random string is used several times throughout the code, one of them to generate the process name to be used during execution.many samples available at cyberium contained the above-mentioned string and this domain was already being used to distribute this botnet when lacework first reported on it. however, the number of samples alien labs has seen with that string has greatly increased in the last months, scattering from the original moobot sample. this could potentially mean that last year\\'s moobots samples were used to create new branches of mirai variants.unlike some other mirai variants, the samples obtained from moobot were encrypted, attempting to evade string-based detection, static analysis of the exploits used, or after compromised activities. however, it did maintain other previously seen characteristics, like a hardcoded list of ip addresses\\xa0to avoid, such as: private ranges, the department of defense, iana ips, ge, hp and others.figure 4. moobot’s ip scan restrictions.the malware writers appear to be very aware of who they’re potential victims are. for this reason, the malware will try to hide its process name by changing it using prctl. the covert process name is “/var/sofia”, which is the name of a video application on the targeted devices.figure 5. moobot process hideout.right after hiding the process, this sample will print to screen the string “9xsspnvgc8aj5pi7m28p” which has been associated with different mirai variants over time (fbot\\xa0and gafgyt). however, it appears this is a passed down characteristic through variant versions, like previously seen with “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, but this time there aren’t any shared iocs with previous attackers.after successful infection, the payload attempts to query the hardcoded c2 on port 12028 to get a list of c2. at the time of study, the cyberium domain was down, and these communications couldn’t be analyzed.early in march 2021, the same links previously mentioned for moobot, for example dns.cyberium[.]cc/arm, were actually providing samples for satori. the satori botnet, also known as fbot, is yet another mirai variant based botnet. unexpectedly, these samples were mingled with other unix botnets in the same malware hosting server.the similarities between moobot and satori samples are vast, since they both are coming from the same mirai source code. these similarities include:the most noteworthy differences observed were:additional samples were identified under the same domain, which on a first investigation appeared to be a mix between the already mentioned moobot and satori samples with a random combination of their characteristics. most of them looked like moobot samples without the encoding or satori without the hardcoded domain.however, the samples are not associated with the current domain under study, probably because it is being left fallow. after pivoting on the scanning ip, delivering the downloaders scripts, it is currently providing the same script with an updated temporary domain, which is currently delivering additional satori/fbot samples packed with upx.alien labs has identified the cyberium malware hosting domain to be providing many different mirai variants, like moobot or satori, during the last year. actors have been jumping between subdomains to recycle their infrastructure as most as possible. at the time of publishing this blog (may 2021) some of the cyberium subdomains were up, but they were not hosting any malware samples. they could be potentially awaiting new requests for c2 lists.several questions remain unanswered. why would the attackers deliver different mirai variants with different c2s on the same campaign? and, are they trying to avoid anti-virus detection through diversification of variants? or, are they trying to improve the botnet resiliency by diversifying c2.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.suricata ids signaturesalert http $external_net any -> $home_net any (msg:\"av exploit tenda router rce (cve-2020-10987)\"; flow:to_server,established;

            "{'titel': 'securing aws policies', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsaws policies are a key foundation in good cloud security, but they are often overlooked. in this blog, we take a quick look on some aws policies, particularly for\\xa0identity and access management\\xa0(iam), that could become problematic if not properly managed. we'll discuss how they can be used against us to generate attacks like: ransomware, data exfiltration, credential abuse, and more. finally, we'll suggest some open source tools for cloud policy assessment and pentesting.\\xa0\\xa0the first step in achieving good security is having effective policies to regulate what can and cannot be done in an environment, both physical devices and cloud infrastructure. these regulatory policies are frequently hard to define and keep up-to-date, especially in a fast-paced environment using infrastructure-as-a-service (iaas). this blog looks at some changes in policies\\xa0which can reduce success in some common attack types involving: exfiltration, ransomware, credential abuse, and more. for that reason, at&t alien labs is sharing an easy ‘what to look for’ list in order to detect some red flags in aws policy changes. it is our hope that this\\xa0list will be helpful\\xa0for security analysts and forensic investigators.policies are spoiler alert, defined by aws policies, which define permissions for identities and resources. every time\\xa0aws identity and access management makes a request of any kind to a resource, a policy determines if the iam is allowed or denied access to that specific resource under the policies for the involved parties.a full understanding of aws policies (types, creation, enforcement, etc.) is outside the scope of this\\xa0blog, but it can be found in aws documentation.people implementing aws policies should have knowledge of the organization, adapting\\xa0policies to needs of the business. afterwards, detection rules should be generated\\xa0for red flags in cloudtrail or other security tools. by doing this, we are avoiding policy changes in a generic manner, for example using ‘*’ to cover the whole principal without setting any conditions to it (mfa, ip, usernames, etc.). the problem resides in changes occurring on a daily basis to the policies, which are often overlooked by analysts. the impact that these changes could have\\xa0is as big as any other event or alert investigated.in order to classify all aws actions involving a policy change that could be used by attackers, we’ll sort them based on the potential final attack type. most of the following techniques would fall under modify cloud compute infrastructure (t1578) but we have attempted to classify them outside of their specific cloud technique - as if the activity was happening in a traditional environment.endpoint denial of service (t1499): adversaries may perform endpoint dos attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. this blockage could be used as an additional impact on top of data encrypted for impact (t1486) to avoid or slow down\\xa0recovery efforts in a ransomware attack. in this scenario, attackers could be trying to block access to several aws resources like: s3, ec2 through efs or ebs, or backups between others.s3: amazon’s storage service can suffer a dos by adding policies that block access to its contents. buckets and access points are both s3 resources that could be impacted by an excessively restrictive policy or access control list (acl), hence their relevance.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:denyaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)additionally, the events deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicy would have a similar effect, since they would be removing the policies where the public access is allowed.detection guidance:event/command:deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicyguardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)in a similar situation, amazon’s elastic file system (efs): any policy change denying access to this storage solution\\xa0could also lead to a dos. due to this, these\\xa0events and resource policies should be closely observed.detection guidance:event/commandputfilesystempolicyeffectdenyactionelasticfilesystem:clientmount or elasticfilesystem:clientwriteguardduty alert-indicator removal on host (t1070): adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files, such as quarantined malware. in this case, removed indicators not only affect the host, but the whole cloud and the log ingestion platform in charge of generating alerts. the main affected resource is cloudwatch, but there are others too.cloudwatch is\\xa0the monitoring service for aws resources\\xa0tracks logs coming from different resources and accounts in aws. blocking the logging access to resources would have a similar effect as deleting logs in a traditional computer.putresourcepolicy gives permission for other aws services to put log events to the current account. a new policy with effect deny on all\\xa0could avoid resources logging on their expected log file, and delay alerting on a detection. additionally, putdestinationpolicy has a similar\\xa0behavior - it has the capability of creating an access policy for existing log destinations. a restrictive policy could lead to a logs not being in the expected log location. in this case, putresourcepolicy api or cli does not allow specifying * as the principal, and each sender account must be listed separately in the policy.several guardduty finding types could notify of any policy log tampering that could impact detection of indicators.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicy or putdestinationpolicyeffect:denyaction:logs:*guardduty alert:stealth:s3/serveraccessloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/cloudtrailloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/loggingconfigurationmodifiedother log events could be of relevance, like putretentionpolicy, but none of their effects would be as drastic as the previously mentioned or are not strictly determined by policies.inhibit system recovery (t1490): blocking access to the backups or modifying permissions to delete them, most likely with ransomware intentions.efs offers an automatic backup system through the command putbackuppolicy, which could be disabled in a ransomware scenario causing slower recovery efforts.detection guidance:event/command:putbackuppolicystatus:disabledbackups: aws offers several solutions for backing up systems (as we have already seen with the efs solution). looking into the aws backup official solution and disabling it or removing permissions to access them has the direct impact of a dos, and aggravates the ransomware scenario.detection guidance:event/command:putbackupvaultaccesspolicyeffect:denyallowaction:backup:*backup:delete*guardduty alert:-exfiltration over web service (t1567): exposes current resources to the internet with the intention of exfiltrating data outside of the organization.s3: as we saw in the dos section, a change in policies could remove public internet access to a bucket or access point. in this situation we are looking at the opposite scenario, a private s3 being made public to leverage it for exfiltration purposes.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:allowaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/bucketpublicaccessgranted or policy:s3/bucketanonymousaccessgrantedelasticsearch: if the domain associated with an elasticsearch instance is public, an attacker could modify any existing condition, like ip addresses\\xa0or command restrictions - to increase the actions that can be performed on this public domain. aws does not have a specific command to modify its access policies for elasticsearch, but they can be modified from the user interface or the api through the domain config, on an individual domain basis.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:es:* (in particular es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig)guardduty alert:-attackers could also create a new elasticsearch domain and include the above-mentioned policies. it is outside the scope of this blog to discuss\\xa0operations involving new resources to exfiltrate data (elasticsearch, s3, efs, etc.). this attack would become noisier, since it involves creating new resources, applying the mentioned policies, and copying any relevant data to these resources. just for reference, this attack would classify as transfer data to cloud account (t1537).elastic container registry (ecr): provides the capability to store docker containers and have them ready for deployment. this deployment availability can also be turned around and be used for exfiltration by\\xa0downloading docker containers from a pre-signed amazon s3 download url. this privilege can be obtained by modifying the setrepositorypolicy for the corresponding ecr and allowing the action getdownloadurlforlayer to access it externally.detection guidance:event/command:setrepositorypolicy or putrepositorypolicyeffect:allowaction:ecr:getdownloadurlforlayerguardduty alert:-os credential dumping (t1003): uses a lack of security to dump credentials either encrypted, hashed or in clear text, to use them later in towards lateral movement or accessing confidential information.aws secrets manager is a great example of a target for a credential access scenario. the secrets in this vault need to be accessed by internal or external resources eventually, and a bad security policy might allow an attacker to take those credentials. these might be encrypted with a kms key, but attackers would still be one step closer to their their goal.an escalation of privileges (or decrease in security) could be achieved through the putresourcepolicy for secretsmanager. an excess of allowed privileges could make credential access easier.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:secretsmanager:* (in particular getsecretvalue)guardduty alert:-aws key management service (kms): is amazon’s key manager to control what users and applications have access to certain cryptographic keys. access to these keys is, as you can expect at this point of the blog, given by a specific policy. changes made to this policy can enable\\xa0several different attacks (like a dos if access is denied to all users), but in this case we are looking at a too permissive policy set with putkeypolicy.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:kms:putkeypolicyguardduty alert:-in addition to the already mentioned events and aws resources, there are others that could be leveraged by attackers, but these fall out of the scope of this blog to keep it a\\xa0reasonable length. just to mention some of these - they would be: amazon simple queue service (sqs) through sqs:addpermission, amazon simple notification service (amazon sns) through sns:addpermission, aws elemental mediastore through putcontainerpolicy, aws lambda through lambda:addpermission, etc.after analyzing some of the most relevant policy changes impacting the cloud environment’s security in your organization, we’ll take a look at some of the aws penetration testing tools available for free, and how they use\\xa0policies.aws offers an access analyzer capable of assessing existing resource-based policies, and focuses on identifying any resources shared with external entities. amazon refers to an external entity as any other aws account, root user, iam user or role, federated user, aws service, anonymous user, or other entity.it is a great resource for some critical resources like s3, kms or secretmanager. however, it lacks coverage to other resources that could be as important, like elasticsearch domains or cloudwatch resource policies.this free cloud pentesting tool provides a deep test of existing policies in aws. the only prerequisite is an aws api credential with privileges to update resource policies. it is capable of running in ‘expose’ mode, modifying just the necessary resources to achieve a backdoor, or ‘smash’ mode, revealing potential security concerns by: enumerating resources, reading and modifying current policies, and finally implanting as many backdoors as possible through weaknesses in the victim’s iam security policies.it offers approximately 30% more coverage than aws iam access analyzer, including coverage for:in the full list of policies required to achieve all the backdoors included with the tool, we can see some policies already mentioned in this blog: ecr:setrepositorypolicy, elasticfilesystem:putfilesystempolicy, es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig, kms:putkeypolicy, lambda:addpermission, logs:putresourcepolicy, s3:putbucketpolicy, secretsmanager:putresourcepolicy.cloudsplaining performs a deep assessment on all the aws iam security policies and identifies violations of least privilege, producing a full html report. the report includes triage items as well as remediation indications, offering the user a very helpful resource to analyze their current configuration and offering improvement possibilities.hacking the cloud is an online encyclopedia supported by volunteers. the webpage contains a list of attacks/tactics/techniques that offensive security professionals can use to pentest their cloud environments. the attacks are not very policy focused, but it does use them in some attacks, like in the “unauthenticated enumeration of iam users and roles”, which is present in pacu too.there are many other open source useful tools for cloud pentesting or policy assessment, like: parliament, pacu, pmapper, repokid, policy sentry.in this blog we have seen several attacks\\xa0that\\xa0could be performed using aws policies - especially if they weren’t properly set up. we've discussed\\xa0the\\xa0importance of aws policies as the foundation of a good cloud security. we have seen how guardduty detects some dangerous policy changes, but leaves out many others that can only be detected through constantly reviewing\\xa0cloudtrail logs. the pentesting tools seen in the blog can help detect holes in the policies. an alternative solution is the use of siems like usm anywhere, with specific detection rules added on a daily basis, thanks to the threat content that the at&t alien labs team adds to the usm anywhere platform.aws policies: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/latest/userguide/access_policies.htmlendgame: https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latestcloudsplaining: https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaininghacking the cloud: https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/connection-tracking/parliament: https://github.com/duo-labs/parliamentpacu: https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/pacu-open-source-aws-exploitation-framework/pmapper: https://github.com/nccgroup/pmapperrepokid: https://github.com/netflix/repokidpolicy sentry: https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry/the findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: ransomware, cloud security, attacks, labs, iam, aws security, open source, aws policyinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.\"}\n",
            "{'titel': 'the rise of qakbot', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was jointly written with ofer caspi. some of the links in this blog require an otx account, and the qakbot infrastructure tracker will require readers to be customers with access to the threat intel subscription.. thanks to the following researchers and the malwarebazaar project:at&t alien labs closely monitors the evolution of crimeware such as the qakbot\\xa0(also known as qbot) malware family and campaigns in connection with qakbot. the jointly coordinated takedown of the actors behind emotet in late january has left a gap in the cybercrime landscape, which qakbot seems poised to fill.key points:qakbot, also known as qbot or pinkslipbot, is a modular information stealer. it has been active since 2007 and primarily used by financially motivated actors. it was initially known as a banking trojan and a loader using c2 servers for payload delivery; however, its use expanded beyond strictly being a banking trojan. the hallmarks of a qakbot infection chain consist of a phishing lure (t1566) delivered via email chain hijacking or spoofed emails that contain context-aware information such as shipping, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, claims, etc. the phishing emails alternate between file attachments (t1566.001) and links (t1566.002). qakbot is often used as a gateway entry, similar to trickbot or emotet, that leads to post exploitation operations leveraging frameworks such as cobalt strike as well as delivering ransomware.qakbot email lures are not the most sophisticated; however, by using contextually aware themes that originate from hijacked email chains or potentially compromised accounts within a user’s social circle, they are effective. figure 1 below illustrates an example of a recent qakbot lure with the subject “re: signed quote” and a zip file attachment labeled “cancellation_letter_272020508-02242021.zip”.figure 1. qakbot \"signed quote\" email lurethe actors further establish the trust and confidence of the targeted user by presenting a semi-official looking docusign graphic that guides the user through the process of enabling the excel 4 macros. a representative sample, 78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a, seen in a recent qakbot campaign is shown in figure 2 below.figure 2. qakbot docusign lureqakbot excel spreadsheets often contain hidden spreadsheets, excel 4.0 macros, spreadsheet formulas, and biff records all designed to pass a visual inspection from the user with the added benefit of bypassing detection mechanisms that attempt to parse multiple legacy formats inside the spreadsheet. figure 3 below shows a screenshot of output from the open-source xlmmacrodeobfuscator tool, which decodes obfuscated excel 4.0 macros.figure 3. xlmmacrodeobfuscator output for a qakbot excel 4.0 macro spreadsheetonce the excel 4.0 macro is decoded it is possible to see the call to urldownloadtofilea, which downloads the qakbot dll in this campaign from http[:]//rlyrt26rnxw02vqijgs[.]com/fera/frid[.]gif. next, the exec function is evaluated which executes “rundll32.exe nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver”. it is also a common tactic for qakbot to execute “regsvr32.exe -s nxckew.wle,dllregisterserver”. both instances are designed to evade sandbox environments that do not supply the expected command line arguments. a representative qakbot dll analyzed by alien labs, 9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28, has two exports: the entry point (0x10005a5d) and dllregisterserver (0x10029c88)and if dllregisterserver is not called via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe with command line options, then only the entry point is called and the malicious code in dllregisterserver is not called. figure 3 below shows improved readability and de-obfuscation of the macro by manually replacing and substituting the cell values and formulas.figure 3. better de-obfuscation of the spreadsheetthe results of our additional de-obfuscation efforts are confirmed when the qakbot excel spreadsheet is run inside a sandbox in figure 4 below.figure 4. otx screenshot showing the “rundll32 ..\\\\nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver\\'\\' executionbefore executing the main payload, the qakbot loader will first test the infected system to see if it is a good candidate for infection. the qakbot loader is responsible for checking its environment to include whether it is running on a virtual machine, identifying any installed and running security and monitoring tools such as antivirus products or common security researcher tools. figure 5 below shows a high-level execution flow of the qakbot loader.figure 5. qakbot execution flowto make detection and analysis harder, qakbot encrypts its strings and decrypts them at runtime before use. once the qakbot execution logic is finished using a string, it will immediately delete the string from memory. an example of this can be seen in figure 6 below, which shows qakbot decrypting a string containing the value for lpprocname passed as a parameter to the getprocaddress api call. the selected function, which has been labeled in ida pro as, “oc_clear_mem” deletes the string memory right after it retrieves the process address.figure 6. qakbot getprocaddress and clear_mem routineswhen executed, qakbot will check whether it has previously been executed on the machine by checking for the specified malware folder. if qakbot discovers it is a first time run, it will relaunch itself from cmd.exe with the /c parameter that will inform the loader to proceed and run its anti-vm checks on the machine and return the results to the parent process. if qakbot detects it is running in a vm environment, then the final payload will not be decrypted since qakbot uses the return value from these checks in its final decryption routine. figure 7 below shows the qakbot environment check logic.figure 7. qakbot environment check logicspecifically, qakbot checks the system for the names of running processes that match the strings listed in table 1 below.process namesfigure 8 below shows the decryption routine for the security and monitoring tool strings (t1140).figure 8. qakbot decrypting tool check stringsqakbot will also add its folder to the windows defender exclusions setting located in the registry (t1112), which prevents defender from scanning qakbot artifacts. the registry location can be seen in figure 9 below.figure 9. qakbot adding exclusion paths to windows defender settingsin addition to the previously mentioned environment check, qakbot collects system information (t1082) such as computer name, system directories, user profiles, and more, which is shown in figure 10 below.figure 10. qakbot system information collectionqakbot will use process hollowing (t1055.012) in order to inject itself into explorer.exe. if it is unsuccessful then qakbot will attempt to inject itself into mobsync.exe or iexplore.exe. the screen shot in figure 11 illustrates the qakbot process name decryption routine.\\xa0figure 11. qakbot routine to decrypt process names for injectionfigure 12 below shows the qakbot logic to overwrite the suspended explorer.exe process and then resume its execution.figure 12. qakbot process hollowing routineadditionally, qakbot abuses the service control manager (scm) to create a child process, which is then detached from the parent when the scm terminates the parent process. qakbot c2 communications begin in this stage to make it more difficult to monitor. figure 13 below shows the scm spawned process abuse technique.figure 13. qakbot abusing scm to spawn a detached processfigure 14 below shows the qakbot c2 ping during the scm interaction.figure 14. qakbot sending c2 pingfinally, if the qakbot loader has verified its execution environment has passed its tests, then qakbot will proceed to decrypt and execute the main qakbot payload, which is hidden as resource “307”. the decryption and import table resolution of its main payload is shown in figure 15 below.figure 15. qakbot decryption and import table resolution of main payloadthe combined anti-analysis and evasion techniques across the infection chain significantly impair antivirus, edr, and other security defenses from detecting and preventing the initial infection. despite the limitations and challenges presented by qakbot dlls there is ample opportunity to detect qakbot loaders signed by revoked and blacklisted malicious certificates. alien labs has identified 42 unique signers and signature serial numbers, which are included in detection methods section to aid in detection and hunting with yara and osquery. additionally, there are a number of behavioral patterns, indicators of behavior (iob), which provide opportunities for detection.alien labs has observed qakbot over the past three months being used in a role similar to trickbot, which includes malspam delivery, stealthy maldocs dropping signed loaders, establishing a foothold, and finally post exploitation activities such as lateral movement, access operations, and ransomware delivery. alien labs actively tracks the qakbot c2 infrastructure for customers, which is available via otx here.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by defenders to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.agent signatures\\xa0the following technical indicators are associated with the reported

which has been previously observed targeting exposed docker infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining purposes and credential theft. the group is using a new detection evasion tool, copied from open source repositories.the purpose of this blog\\xa0is to share new technical intelligence and provide detection and analysis options for defenders.at&t alien labs previously reported on teamtnt cryptomining malware using a new memory loader based on ezuri and written in golang. since then, teamtnt has added another tool to their list of capabilities.the objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.the tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on github, described as \"hide a process under linux using the ld preloader.\\'\\' preloading allows the system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. if the custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the system libraries, the custom version will override it.the tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.the new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the teamtnt cryptominer binary or ircbot (figure 1):figure 1. base64 encoded script, via alien labs analysis.upon binary execution,

            "{'titel': 'malware using new ezuri memory loader', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was written by ofer caspi and fernando martinez of at&t alien labsmultiple threat actors have recently started using a go language (golang) tool to act as a packer and avoid antivirus detection. additionally, the ezuri memory loader tool acts as a malware loader and executes its payload in memory, without writing the file to disk. while this technique is known and commonly used by windows malware, it is less popular in linux environments. the loader decrypts the malicious malware and executes it using memfd create (as described in this blog in 2018). when creating a process, the system returns a file descriptor to an anonymous file in \\'/proc/pid/fd/\\' which is visible only in the filesystem.figure 1 shows a code snippet from the loader, containing the information it uses in order to decrypt the payload using the aes algorithm. figure 1. loader code snippet via alien labs analysis.the loader, written in golang, is taken from the \"ezuri\" code on github via the user guitmz. this user originally created the elf loader around march 2019, when he wrote a blog about the technique to run elf executables from memory and shared the loader on his github. additionally, a similar user ‘tmz’ (presumably associated with the previously mentioned ‘guitmz’) posted this same code in late august, on a small forum where malware samples are shared.the guitmz user even ran tests against virustotal to prove the efficiency of the code, uploading a detected linux.cephei sample (35308b8b770d2d4f78299262f595a0769e55152cb432d0efc42292db01609a18) with 30/61 av detections in virustotal, compared to the zero av detections by the same sample hidden with the ezuri code (ddbb714157f2ef91c1ec350cdf1d1f545290967f61491404c81b4e6e52f5c41f).the execution flow of the loader is to first decrypt the payload and then execute it from memory (figure 2):figure 2. execution flow, retrieved from alien labs analysis.guitmz gave this sample the name ezuri, probably after the card with the same name from the card game “magic: the gathering.” \\xa0this card has the capability to “regenerate another target elf,” reflecting the \\xa0malware’s capability of loading and executing an elf file in memory.at&t alien labs team accessed guitmz’s upload of code for analysis. the tool is written in golang and is intuitive to use. when executing, it first asks the path for the payload to be encrypted, along with the password to be used for aes encryption. if no password is given, the tool generates one, which is used to hide the malware within the loader. after the user\\'s input, the packer compiles the loader with the payload encrypted within it, so it can be decrypted and executed in memory once it is placed in the victim’s system. figure 4 shows the main function of the executable, where the file is first decrypted by “aesdec” to then be run in memory by “runfrommemory”. figure 3 shows ezuri main function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.figure 4 shows the “runfrommemory” function used to execute the payload in memory without placing the detectable malware on disk.figure 4 shows ezuri runfrommemory function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.to use the tool, the user will be requested to enter the file to be hidden, with a target process name as well as an optional aes key for encryption (figure 5):figure 5 shows ezuri execution, retrieved from alien labs analysis.at&t alien labs has identified several malware authors leveraging the ezuri loader in the last few months, including teamtnt, which was the first identified. teamtnt is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least april 2020, when the security firm trend micro first reported on them. the main focus of the group is to target docker systems with misconfigurations, as well as unprotected and exposed management apis, to later install ddos bots and cryptominers in the infected systems. a few months after the trend micro report, in august 2020, cado security found new developments in the teamtnt group. in october 2020, palo alto networks unit42 identified new variants of the cryptomining malware used by teamtnt named “black-t.” this sample first installs three network scanners, and then inspects memory in an attempt to retrieve any type of credentials located in the memory. additionally, unit42 identified several german-language strings in some of the tnt scripts.the last sample identified by palo alto networks unit42 is actually an ezuri loader. the decrypted payload is an elf file packed with upx, which is a known sample from teamtnt, first seen in june 2020 (e15550481e89dbd154b875ce50cc5af4b49f9ff7b837d9ac5b5594e5d63966a3).the techniques and code similarities between the original tool, named ezuri, and the one recently used by teamtnt are vast. the most evident one being the \\'ezuri\\' string in the compiled binary (figure 6):figure 6 shows ezuri string in teamtnt\\xa0sample retrieved from alien labs analysis.using this packer, the antivirus (av) detection drops dramatically. looking at the teamtnt malware detections before using ezuri packer (b494ca3b7bae2ab9a5197b81e928baae5b8eac77dfdc7fe1223fee8f27024772), we see 28/62 av detections of the malware, while the ezuri packed version (751014e0154d219dea8c2e999714c32fd98f817782588cd7af355d2488eb1c80) drops to only 3/64 av detections.in addition to teamtnt, there were several gafgyt samples observed (popular iot device malware with ddos attacks purposes). several malware authors have been using an open source golang tool to act as a malware loader, using a known technique to load the elf binaries into memory and avoid using easy-to-detect files on disk. the authors use the open source tool ezuri, to load its previously seen payloads and avoid antivirus detections on the file. the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe

            "{'titel': 'trickbot bazarloader in depth', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsofer caspi, a fellow alien labs researcher, co-authored this blog.at&t alien labs actively tracks the trickbot group through an automated malware analysis system, hunting, and in-depth technical research. on april 20th, 2020 independent security researchers “pancak3lullz” (@pancak3lullz) and vitali kremez (@vk_intel) posted a tweet regarding two new trickbot modules aptly named “bazarloader” and “bazarbackdoor” after attempted command and control (c2) communications with the emercoin dns (emerdns) .bazar domains. emerdns is desirable for attackers because it is a distributed blockchain that is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. alien labs’ automated malware analysis engine had picked up these samples a few days earlier (ex: 7c93d9175a38c23d44d76d9a883f7f3da1e244c2ab6c3ac9f29a9c9e20d20a5f)bleepingcomputer posted a blog with input from vitali kremez regarding a phishing campaign distributed through the sendgrid email marketing platform delivering covid-19 lures that ultimately led to the trickbot bazarbackdoor. the purpose of this blog is to provide additional technical details and an in-depth study of the signed trickbot bazarloader.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0since trickbot was discovered in 2016 it has been involved in information stealing, credential theft, ransomware, bitcoin mining, and loading other common crimeware malware as a first or second stage loader. for initial access as a first stage loader it typically accomplishes its objective through spear phishing links (t1192) or spear phishing attachments (t1193) using macro enabled microsoft office files. as a second stage payload and dynamic link library (dll) it is frequently loaded by emotet. to a lesser extent trickbot has been loaded by ostap javascript downloader and buer loader. in higher priority, higher profile trickbot anchor campaigns that target enterprises, powertrick and more_eggs/terraloader have been used to load other frameworks.trickbot has recently added a remote desktop protocol (rdp) brute force scanner module, an active directory (ad) harvesting module, and the mexec executor module. there are some indications that trickbot may be moving away from their mshare, mworm, and tabdll modules for retrieving payloads from urls in favor of the “nworm” module performing this task. it is important to note that trickbot group prefers to use shellcode “file-less” modules making detection more difficult.alien labs has previously identified digitally signed trickbot loaders, one of which was signed by an entity named “vb corporate pty. ltd.” pivoting in virustotal on the signer shows the first submission was on 2020-01-02 20:24:57. historically, the trickbot group has continued to reuse their revoked certificates to sign trickbot loaders as long as six months after the initial date of detection on virustotal. a list of known trickbot signers is included below. the associated signature serial numbers are included in the yara rule in the appendix.the trickbot bazarloader authors have produced an advanced module, with a significant amount of obfuscation. the bazarloader/cryptor uses multiple routines to hide api calls and embedded strings, which are then decrypted and resolved at runtime. once executed, the loader will allocate memory to store and decrypt its shellcode, which will be allocated to a numa node for faster execution. after allocation and decryption, the next instructions will jump to the shellcode that will be executed on the heap.next, the malware will try to communicate with .bazar domain c2 servers. once the c2 has been established, the loader will try to inject its payload into a system process using the process hollowing technique (t1093), which will create a suspended thread, unmap the destination image from memory, allocate new memory in the target process, copy the shellcode into the target process, set the thread context, and resume the process. in the sample analyzed, 1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83, the loader will first attempt to inject into an “svchost” process, and if injection fails, it will try to inject into the “explorer.exe” process, and if injection fails again as a last-ditch effort the loader will attempt to inject into the “cmd.exe” process. for persistence the loader will create a registry key under “hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\winlogon\\\\userinit”.the malware uses the windows api “virtualallocexnuma” function to allocate memory for its shellcode to be executed. the “virtualallocexnuma” function is used to allocate memory on a numa node, which allows for faster execution. the implementation can be seen in figure 1 below. it is interesting to note that the “virtualallocexnuma” function is not commonly used in process injection.figure 1. api resolution and shellcode decryption routinesin figure 1 above the bazarloader allocates memory using the uncommon “virtualallocexnuma” routine, and then it uses two iterations of the decryption routine to decrypt its shellcode. in the second call to the decrypt function some of the encryption key bytes are changed based on function parameters. in figure 2 below a representation of the decompiled decrypt routine can be seen importing the encryption key, modifying the encryption key bytes dependent on the parameters passed, and then decrypting the data.figure 2. decryption routinethe bazarloader authors have created dozens of decryption routines, and with almost each string including apis, dlls, and c2s there is a once per use unique decryption routine. an example of multiple decryption routines can be seen in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 below.figure 3. decryption routinefigure 4. decryption routinefigure 5. decryption routinethe loader uses the same decryption technique described above to resolve the api calls it uses during execution. the windows api resolution can be seen in figure 6 below.figure 6. windows api resolutionfor injection, the malware resolves apis from the ntdll.dll after it loads from disk and checks that there are no inline hooks within its function, that could be created for example by av software that tracks those api calls.the targeted processes for injection can be seen in figure 7 below.figure 7. targeted svchost, explorer, and cmd windows processes\\xa0the bazarloader injection code can be seen

            "{'titel': 'darkside raas in linux version', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs recently analyzed the linux version of the darkside ransomware, one of the most active ransomware in the last quarter. shortly after hitting colonial pipeline, darkside developers announced they would be closing operations.linux and unix servers have always been a preferred option for servers and data centers, likely due to the small attack surface of the servers, tight configurations, and lack of user interaction. however, they are often set up and then forgotten, left without detection or protection mechanisms. this makes them very attractive to attackers. by infecting unprotected virtualization servers, attackers can perform devastating attacks on companies, taking down all the services of a company with a single infection.first discovered in august 2020, darkside is a group that operates ransomware as a service (raas), and attacks by their network of affiliates have infected many companies worldwide. the most high profile infection happened when a darkside affiliate hit the network of one of the major oil pipeline companies\\xa0in the us, colonial pipeline, causing the company to shut down operations for days. after this attack — likely due to the fact that it drew unwanted levels of attention to the group globally — the malware authors announced publicly the closure of their service. nevertheless, there is evidence that the group has completed a linux version of its malware that is targeting esxi, servers hosting vmware virtual machines. to this point, the authors announced the darkside 2.0 version with linux capabilities on march 9, 2021 in the xss forum:figure 1. example of linux version features and information announced by malware authors on xss forum. \\xa0unlike the windows version of the malware that targets any windows endpoint, darkside linux version is mostly targeting esxi servers. its default configuration includes the root path of esx server machines. \\xa0targeted extensions are 'vmdk', 'log', 'vmem', 'vmsn' that are used in esx servers for saving virtual machines information, data, and logs.the malware is quite informative and prints to the screen most of the actions it performs, which is an uncommon behavior for malware. this could imply that the malware is being deployed manually. the malware is written in c++ and it’s also using several open-source libraries that were imported and compiled with the malware code into one binary. some of these libraries are: crypto++\\xa0used for encryption, boost\\xa0used for logging purposes, and curl\\xa0used for http requests. the use of these libraries enables the final binary to be a 2.7mb file size. for example, to communicate with an infected machine with its command and control (c&c), the malware uses libcurl functions that were compiled with the rest of the code.in addition, the malware supports command line parameters during execution to replace almost, if not all, of the default configuration variables.figure 2. parameters supported by the malware.the malware also supports shutting down virtual machines by executing the esxcli commands, a special console on esx servers that allows it to interact with virtual machines from the command line.figure 3. abusing esxcli command.when executed, the malware prints its configuration to the terminal. this includes the root path to encrypt, rsa key information, targeted file extensions to encrypt, c2 addresses, and more, as seen in figure 4.figure 4. darkside

            "{'titel': 'malware hosting domain cyberium fanning out mirai variants', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs has observed the mirai variant botnet, known as moobot, scanning for known but uncommon vulnerabilities in tenda routers, resulting in a considerable peak in our internal telemetry. the research associated with this peak resulted in the discovery of a malware hosting domain, providing several different mirai variants, like moobot and satori.key points:during the end of march, at&t alien labs observed a spike in exploitation attempts for tenda remote code execution (rce) vulnerability cve-2020-10987. this spike was observed throughout a significant number of clients, in the space of a few hours. this vulnerability is not commonly used by web scanners and was barely detected by our honeypots during the last six months, except for a minor peak in november.this exploit can be identified by the url that is requested, which includes ‘setusbunload’ with the payload assigned to the vulnerable parameter ‘devicename’. this payload contains the logic to change the execution path to a temporary location, wget a file from a malware hosting page, provide execution permissions, and execute it.figure 1. binaryedge sensor detecting the vulnerability scan.following this thread, a single actor was identified to be behind these scans in late march — at the time, the actor appeared to have no previous activity. the scan for tenda vulnerable routers only lasted one day, but the scanning activity continued for several weeks, including the below vulnerabilities:some of these exploit attempts were captured by honeypots. all of them appeared to be pulling their next iteration of the malware from the same malware hosting page: dns.cyberium[.]cc.when this domain was investigated, several campaigns were identified, going back at least one year to may 2020. most of the attacks lasted for approximately a week while they hosted several mirai variants, after which they left the subdomain unresolvable. however, this seems to be the behavior of the threat actor in between operations. the actors appear to come back to the same domain with a new subdomain for each new campaign. activity in between campaigns goes quiet to increase the trust of the original domain. keeping a long-running existing domain while issuing brand new one domain helps to divert attention to the new domain and thus distract from the original.figure 2. riskiq heatmap of cyberium[.]cc.the full list of subdomains/campaigns identified from this domain is:we were able to identify other infrastructure that we assess with high confidence is controlled by the same actor and has been used as moobot command and control in the past.all of the domains use the same:the first request to these malware hosting pages was for a bash script, which aimed to download later stages of the malware. as seen in the screenshot below, the script attempts to download a list of filenames (associated with different cpu architectures), executes each one of them, achieves persistence through a crontab that redownloads the bash script itself, and finally deletes itself.figure 3. tenda downloader script.this script is very similar to downloaders previously seen for mirai variants. the minor modifications appear to be on the downloading server, persistence methods (if any) and the filename, usually named after the vulnerable device vendor.during the time this domain was available and delivering malware, at least three different variants of mirai were identified: moobot, satori/fbot, and other samples unassociated with these botnets. one of the peculiarities of this domain was how it juggled between mirai variants, even under the same filenames. the same url could be hosting satori one day and moobot the week after.in october 2020, lacework\\xa0reported on a new mirai variant called moobot. this variant mainly chased exposed and vulnerable dockers apis to include them into their ddos botnet. one of the main distinctions of this variant has been a hardcoded string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, compared to the mirai source code which used the string “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw012345678” as a seed to generate an alphanumeric string. this random string is used several times throughout the code, one of them to generate the process name to be used during execution.many samples available at cyberium contained the above-mentioned string and this domain was already being used to distribute this botnet when lacework first reported on it. however, the number of samples alien labs has seen with that string has greatly increased in the last months, scattering from the original moobot sample. this could potentially mean that last year\\'s moobots samples were used to create new branches of mirai variants.unlike some other mirai variants, the samples obtained from moobot were encrypted, attempting to evade string-based detection, static analysis of the exploits used, or after compromised activities. however, it did maintain other previously seen characteristics, like a hardcoded list of ip addresses\\xa0to avoid, such as: private ranges, the department of defense, iana ips, ge, hp and others.figure 4. moobot’s ip scan restrictions.the malware writers appear to be very aware of who they’re potential victims are. for this reason, the malware will try to hide its process name by changing it using prctl. the covert process name is “/var/sofia”, which is the name of a video application on the targeted devices.figure 5. moobot process hideout.right after hiding the process, this sample will print to screen the string “9xsspnvgc8aj5pi7m28p” which has been associated with different mirai variants over time (fbot\\xa0and gafgyt). however, it appears this is a passed down characteristic through variant versions, like previously seen with “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, but this time there aren’t any shared iocs with previous attackers.after successful infection, the payload attempts to query the hardcoded c2 on port 12028 to get a list of c2. at the time of study, the cyberium domain was down, and these communications couldn’t be analyzed.early in march 2021, the same links previously mentioned for moobot, for example dns.cyberium[.]cc/arm, were actually providing samples for satori. the satori botnet, also known as fbot, is yet another mirai variant based botnet. unexpectedly, these samples were mingled with other unix botnets in the same malware hosting server.the similarities between moobot and satori samples are vast, since they both are coming from the same mirai source code. these similarities include:the most noteworthy differences observed were:additional samples were identified under the same domain, which on a first investigation appeared to be a mix between the already mentioned moobot and satori samples with a random combination of their characteristics. most of them looked like moobot samples without the encoding or satori without the hardcoded domain.however, the samples are not associated with the current domain under study, probably because it is being left fallow. after pivoting on the scanning ip, delivering the downloaders scripts, it is currently providing the same script with an updated temporary domain, which is currently delivering additional satori/fbot samples packed with upx.alien labs has identified the cyberium malware hosting domain to be providing many different mirai variants, like moobot or satori, during the last year. actors have been jumping between subdomains to recycle their infrastructure as most as possible. at the time of publishing this blog (may 2021) some of the cyberium subdomains were up, but they were not hosting any malware samples. they could be potentially awaiting new requests for c2 lists.several questions remain unanswered. why would the attackers deliver different mirai variants with different c2s on the same campaign? and, are they trying to avoid anti-virus detection through diversification of variants? or, are they trying to improve the botnet resiliency by diversifying c2.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.suricata ids signaturesalert http $external_net any -> $home_net any (msg:\"av exploit tenda router rce (cve-2020-10987)\"; flow:to_server,established;

            "{'titel': 'securing aws policies', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsaws policies are a key foundation in good cloud security, but they are often overlooked. in this blog, we take a quick look on some aws policies, particularly for\\xa0identity and access management\\xa0(iam), that could become problematic if not properly managed. we'll discuss how they can be used against us to generate attacks like: ransomware, data exfiltration, credential abuse, and more. finally, we'll suggest some open source tools for cloud policy assessment and pentesting.\\xa0\\xa0the first step in achieving good security is having effective policies to regulate what can and cannot be done in an environment, both physical devices and cloud infrastructure. these regulatory policies are frequently hard to define and keep up-to-date, especially in a fast-paced environment using infrastructure-as-a-service (iaas). this blog looks at some changes in policies\\xa0which can reduce success in some common attack types involving: exfiltration, ransomware, credential abuse, and more. for that reason, at&t alien labs is sharing an easy ‘what to look for’ list in order to detect some red flags in aws policy changes. it is our hope that this\\xa0list will be helpful\\xa0for security analysts and forensic investigators.policies are spoiler alert, defined by aws policies, which define permissions for identities and resources. every time\\xa0aws identity and access management makes a request of any kind to a resource, a policy determines if the iam is allowed or denied access to that specific resource under the policies for the involved parties.a full understanding of aws policies (types, creation, enforcement, etc.) is outside the scope of this\\xa0blog, but it can be found in aws documentation.people implementing aws policies should have knowledge of the organization, adapting\\xa0policies to needs of the business. afterwards, detection rules should be generated\\xa0for red flags in cloudtrail or other security tools. by doing this, we are avoiding policy changes in a generic manner, for example using ‘*’ to cover the whole principal without setting any conditions to it (mfa, ip, usernames, etc.). the problem resides in changes occurring on a daily basis to the policies, which are often overlooked by analysts. the impact that these changes could have\\xa0is as big as any other event or alert investigated.in order to classify all aws actions involving a policy change that could be used by attackers, we’ll sort them based on the potential final attack type. most of the following techniques would fall under modify cloud compute infrastructure (t1578) but we have attempted to classify them outside of their specific cloud technique - as if the activity was happening in a traditional environment.endpoint denial of service (t1499): adversaries may perform endpoint dos attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. this blockage could be used as an additional impact on top of data encrypted for impact (t1486) to avoid or slow down\\xa0recovery efforts in a ransomware attack. in this scenario, attackers could be trying to block access to several aws resources like: s3, ec2 through efs or ebs, or backups between others.s3: amazon’s storage service can suffer a dos by adding policies that block access to its contents. buckets and access points are both s3 resources that could be impacted by an excessively restrictive policy or access control list (acl), hence their relevance.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:denyaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)additionally, the events deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicy would have a similar effect, since they would be removing the policies where the public access is allowed.detection guidance:event/command:deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicyguardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)in a similar situation, amazon’s elastic file system (efs): any policy change denying access to this storage solution\\xa0could also lead to a dos. due to this, these\\xa0events and resource policies should be closely observed.detection guidance:event/commandputfilesystempolicyeffectdenyactionelasticfilesystem:clientmount or elasticfilesystem:clientwriteguardduty alert-indicator removal on host (t1070): adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files, such as quarantined malware. in this case, removed indicators not only affect the host, but the whole cloud and the log ingestion platform in charge of generating alerts. the main affected resource is cloudwatch, but there are others too.cloudwatch is\\xa0the monitoring service for aws resources\\xa0tracks logs coming from different resources and accounts in aws. blocking the logging access to resources would have a similar effect as deleting logs in a traditional computer.putresourcepolicy gives permission for other aws services to put log events to the current account. a new policy with effect deny on all\\xa0could avoid resources logging on their expected log file, and delay alerting on a detection. additionally, putdestinationpolicy has a similar\\xa0behavior - it has the capability of creating an access policy for existing log destinations. a restrictive policy could lead to a logs not being in the expected log location. in this case, putresourcepolicy api or cli does not allow specifying * as the principal, and each sender account must be listed separately in the policy.several guardduty finding types could notify of any policy log tampering that could impact detection of indicators.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicy or putdestinationpolicyeffect:denyaction:logs:*guardduty alert:stealth:s3/serveraccessloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/cloudtrailloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/loggingconfigurationmodifiedother log events could be of relevance, like putretentionpolicy, but none of their effects would be as drastic as the previously mentioned or are not strictly determined by policies.inhibit system recovery (t1490): blocking access to the backups or modifying permissions to delete them, most likely with ransomware intentions.efs offers an automatic backup system through the command putbackuppolicy, which could be disabled in a ransomware scenario causing slower recovery efforts.detection guidance:event/command:putbackuppolicystatus:disabledbackups: aws offers several solutions for backing up systems (as we have already seen with the efs solution). looking into the aws backup official solution and disabling it or removing permissions to access them has the direct impact of a dos, and aggravates the ransomware scenario.detection guidance:event/command:putbackupvaultaccesspolicyeffect:denyallowaction:backup:*backup:delete*guardduty alert:-exfiltration over web service (t1567): exposes current resources to the internet with the intention of exfiltrating data outside of the organization.s3: as we saw in the dos section, a change in policies could remove public internet access to a bucket or access point. in this situation we are looking at the opposite scenario, a private s3 being made public to leverage it for exfiltration purposes.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:allowaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/bucketpublicaccessgranted or policy:s3/bucketanonymousaccessgrantedelasticsearch: if the domain associated with an elasticsearch instance is public, an attacker could modify any existing condition, like ip addresses\\xa0or command restrictions - to increase the actions that can be performed on this public domain. aws does not have a specific command to modify its access policies for elasticsearch, but they can be modified from the user interface or the api through the domain config, on an individual domain basis.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:es:* (in particular es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig)guardduty alert:-attackers could also create a new elasticsearch domain and include the above-mentioned policies. it is outside the scope of this blog to discuss\\xa0operations involving new resources to exfiltrate data (elasticsearch, s3, efs, etc.). this attack would become noisier, since it involves creating new resources, applying the mentioned policies, and copying any relevant data to these resources. just for reference, this attack would classify as transfer data to cloud account (t1537).elastic container registry (ecr): provides the capability to store docker containers and have them ready for deployment. this deployment availability can also be turned around and be used for exfiltration by\\xa0downloading docker containers from a pre-signed amazon s3 download url. this privilege can be obtained by modifying the setrepositorypolicy for the corresponding ecr and allowing the action getdownloadurlforlayer to access it externally.detection guidance:event/command:setrepositorypolicy or putrepositorypolicyeffect:allowaction:ecr:getdownloadurlforlayerguardduty alert:-os credential dumping (t1003): uses a lack of security to dump credentials either encrypted, hashed or in clear text, to use them later in towards lateral movement or accessing confidential information.aws secrets manager is a great example of a target for a credential access scenario. the secrets in this vault need to be accessed by internal or external resources eventually, and a bad security policy might allow an attacker to take those credentials. these might be encrypted with a kms key, but attackers would still be one step closer to their their goal.an escalation of privileges (or decrease in security) could be achieved through the putresourcepolicy for secretsmanager. an excess of allowed privileges could make credential access easier.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:secretsmanager:* (in particular getsecretvalue)guardduty alert:-aws key management service (kms): is amazon’s key manager to control what users and applications have access to certain cryptographic keys. access to these keys is, as you can expect at this point of the blog, given by a specific policy. changes made to this policy can enable\\xa0several different attacks (like a dos if access is denied to all users), but in this case we are looking at a too permissive policy set with putkeypolicy.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:kms:putkeypolicyguardduty alert:-in addition to the already mentioned events and aws resources, there are others that could be leveraged by attackers, but these fall out of the scope of this blog to keep it a\\xa0reasonable length. just to mention some of these - they would be: amazon simple queue service (sqs) through sqs:addpermission, amazon simple notification service (amazon sns) through sns:addpermission, aws elemental mediastore through putcontainerpolicy, aws lambda through lambda:addpermission, etc.after analyzing some of the most relevant policy changes impacting the cloud environment’s security in your organization, we’ll take a look at some of the aws penetration testing tools available for free, and how they use\\xa0policies.aws offers an access analyzer capable of assessing existing resource-based policies, and focuses on identifying any resources shared with external entities. amazon refers to an external entity as any other aws account, root user, iam user or role, federated user, aws service, anonymous user, or other entity.it is a great resource for some critical resources like s3, kms or secretmanager. however, it lacks coverage to other resources that could be as important, like elasticsearch domains or cloudwatch resource policies.this free cloud pentesting tool provides a deep test of existing policies in aws. the only prerequisite is an aws api credential with privileges to update resource policies. it is capable of running in ‘expose’ mode, modifying just the necessary resources to achieve a backdoor, or ‘smash’ mode, revealing potential security concerns by: enumerating resources, reading and modifying current policies, and finally implanting as many backdoors as possible through weaknesses in the victim’s iam security policies.it offers approximately 30% more coverage than aws iam access analyzer, including coverage for:in the full list of policies required to achieve all the backdoors included with the tool, we can see some policies already mentioned in this blog: ecr:setrepositorypolicy, elasticfilesystem:putfilesystempolicy, es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig, kms:putkeypolicy, lambda:addpermission, logs:putresourcepolicy, s3:putbucketpolicy, secretsmanager:putresourcepolicy.cloudsplaining performs a deep assessment on all the aws iam security policies and identifies violations of least privilege, producing a full html report. the report includes triage items as well as remediation indications, offering the user a very helpful resource to analyze their current configuration and offering improvement possibilities.hacking the cloud is an online encyclopedia supported by volunteers. the webpage contains a list of attacks/tactics/techniques that offensive security professionals can use to pentest their cloud environments. the attacks are not very policy focused, but it does use them in some attacks, like in the “unauthenticated enumeration of iam users and roles”, which is present in pacu too.there are many other open source useful tools for cloud pentesting or policy assessment, like: parliament, pacu, pmapper, repokid, policy sentry.in this blog we have seen several attacks\\xa0that\\xa0could be performed using aws policies - especially if they weren’t properly set up. we've discussed\\xa0the\\xa0importance of aws policies as the foundation of a good cloud security. we have seen how guardduty detects some dangerous policy changes, but leaves out many others that can only be detected through constantly reviewing\\xa0cloudtrail logs. the pentesting tools seen in the blog can help detect holes in the policies. an alternative solution is the use of siems like usm anywhere, with specific detection rules added on a daily basis, thanks to the threat content that the at&t alien labs team adds to the usm anywhere platform.aws policies: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/latest/userguide/access_policies.htmlendgame: https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latestcloudsplaining: https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaininghacking the cloud: https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/connection-tracking/parliament: https://github.com/duo-labs/parliamentpacu: https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/pacu-open-source-aws-exploitation-framework/pmapper: https://github.com/nccgroup/pmapperrepokid: https://github.com/netflix/repokidpolicy sentry: https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry/the findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: ransomware, cloud security, attacks, labs, iam, aws security, open source, aws policyinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.\"}\n",
            "{'titel': 'the rise of qakbot', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was jointly written with ofer caspi. some of the links in this blog require an otx account, and the qakbot infrastructure tracker will require readers to be customers with access to the threat intel subscription.. thanks to the following researchers and the malwarebazaar project:at&t alien labs closely monitors the evolution of crimeware such as the qakbot\\xa0(also known as qbot) malware family and campaigns in connection with qakbot. the jointly coordinated takedown of the actors behind emotet in late january has left a gap in the cybercrime landscape, which qakbot seems poised to fill.key points:qakbot, also known as qbot or pinkslipbot, is a modular information stealer. it has been active since 2007 and primarily used by financially motivated actors. it was initially known as a banking trojan and a loader using c2 servers for payload delivery; however, its use expanded beyond strictly being a banking trojan. the hallmarks of a qakbot infection chain consist of a phishing lure (t1566) delivered via email chain hijacking or spoofed emails that contain context-aware information such as shipping, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, claims, etc. the phishing emails alternate between file attachments (t1566.001) and links (t1566.002). qakbot is often used as a gateway entry, similar to trickbot or emotet, that leads to post exploitation operations leveraging frameworks such as cobalt strike as well as delivering ransomware.qakbot email lures are not the most sophisticated; however, by using contextually aware themes that originate from hijacked email chains or potentially compromised accounts within a user’s social circle, they are effective. figure 1 below illustrates an example of a recent qakbot lure with the subject “re: signed quote” and a zip file attachment labeled “cancellation_letter_272020508-02242021.zip”.figure 1. qakbot \"signed quote\" email lurethe actors further establish the trust and confidence of the targeted user by presenting a semi-official looking docusign graphic that guides the user through the process of enabling the excel 4 macros. a representative sample, 78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a, seen in a recent qakbot campaign is shown in figure 2 below.figure 2. qakbot docusign lureqakbot excel spreadsheets often contain hidden spreadsheets, excel 4.0 macros, spreadsheet formulas, and biff records all designed to pass a visual inspection from the user with the added benefit of bypassing detection mechanisms that attempt to parse multiple legacy formats inside the spreadsheet. figure 3 below shows a screenshot of output from the open-source xlmmacrodeobfuscator tool, which decodes obfuscated excel 4.0 macros.figure 3. xlmmacrodeobfuscator output for a qakbot excel 4.0 macro spreadsheetonce the excel 4.0 macro is decoded it is possible to see the call to urldownloadtofilea, which downloads the qakbot dll in this campaign from http[:]//rlyrt26rnxw02vqijgs[.]com/fera/frid[.]gif. next, the exec function is evaluated which executes “rundll32.exe nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver”. it is also a common tactic for qakbot to execute “regsvr32.exe -s nxckew.wle,dllregisterserver”. both instances are designed to evade sandbox environments that do not supply the expected command line arguments. a representative qakbot dll analyzed by alien labs, 9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28, has two exports: the entry point (0x10005a5d) and dllregisterserver (0x10029c88)and if dllregisterserver is not called via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe with command line options, then only the entry point is called and the malicious code in dllregisterserver is not called. figure 3 below shows improved readability and de-obfuscation of the macro by manually replacing and substituting the cell values and formulas.figure 3. better de-obfuscation of the spreadsheetthe results of our additional de-obfuscation efforts are confirmed when the qakbot excel spreadsheet is run inside a sandbox in figure 4 below.figure 4. otx screenshot showing the “rundll32 ..\\\\nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver\\'\\' executionbefore executing the main payload, the qakbot loader will first test the infected system to see if it is a good candidate for infection. the qakbot loader is responsible for checking its environment to include whether it is running on a virtual machine, identifying any installed and running security and monitoring tools such as antivirus products or common security researcher tools. figure 5 below shows a high-level execution flow of the qakbot loader.figure 5. qakbot execution flowto make detection and analysis harder, qakbot encrypts its strings and decrypts them at runtime before use. once the qakbot execution logic is finished using a string, it will immediately delete the string from memory. an example of this can be seen in figure 6 below, which shows qakbot decrypting a string containing the value for lpprocname passed as a parameter to the getprocaddress api call. the selected function, which has been labeled in ida pro as, “oc_clear_mem” deletes the string memory right after it retrieves the process address.figure 6. qakbot getprocaddress and clear_mem routineswhen executed, qakbot will check whether it has previously been executed on the machine by checking for the specified malware folder. if qakbot discovers it is a first time run, it will relaunch itself from cmd.exe with the /c parameter that will inform the loader to proceed and run its anti-vm checks on the machine and return the results to the parent process. if qakbot detects it is running in a vm environment, then the final payload will not be decrypted since qakbot uses the return value from these checks in its final decryption routine. figure 7 below shows the qakbot environment check logic.figure 7. qakbot environment check logicspecifically, qakbot checks the system for the names of running processes that match the strings listed in table 1 below.process namesfigure 8 below shows the decryption routine for the security and monitoring tool strings (t1140).figure 8. qakbot decrypting tool check stringsqakbot will also add its folder to the windows defender exclusions setting located in the registry (t1112), which prevents defender from scanning qakbot artifacts. the registry location can be seen in figure 9 below.figure 9. qakbot adding exclusion paths to windows defender settingsin addition to the previously mentioned environment check, qakbot collects system information (t1082) such as computer name, system directories, user profiles, and more, which is shown in figure 10 below.figure 10. qakbot system information collectionqakbot will use process hollowing (t1055.012) in order to inject itself into explorer.exe. if it is unsuccessful then qakbot will attempt to inject itself into mobsync.exe or iexplore.exe. the screen shot in figure 11 illustrates the qakbot process name decryption routine.\\xa0figure 11. qakbot routine to decrypt process names for injectionfigure 12 below shows the qakbot logic to overwrite the suspended explorer.exe process and then resume its execution.figure 12. qakbot process hollowing routineadditionally, qakbot abuses the service control manager (scm) to create a child process, which is then detached from the parent when the scm terminates the parent process. qakbot c2 communications begin in this stage to make it more difficult to monitor. figure 13 below shows the scm spawned process abuse technique.figure 13. qakbot abusing scm to spawn a detached processfigure 14 below shows the qakbot c2 ping during the scm interaction.figure 14. qakbot sending c2 pingfinally, if the qakbot loader has verified its execution environment has passed its tests, then qakbot will proceed to decrypt and execute the main qakbot payload, which is hidden as resource “307”. the decryption and import table resolution of its main payload is shown in figure 15 below.figure 15. qakbot decryption and import table resolution of main payloadthe combined anti-analysis and evasion techniques across the infection chain significantly impair antivirus, edr, and other security defenses from detecting and preventing the initial infection. despite the limitations and challenges presented by qakbot dlls there is ample opportunity to detect qakbot loaders signed by revoked and blacklisted malicious certificates. alien labs has identified 42 unique signers and signature serial numbers, which are included in detection methods section to aid in detection and hunting with yara and osquery. additionally, there are a number of behavioral patterns, indicators of behavior (iob), which provide opportunities for detection.alien labs has observed qakbot over the past three months being used in a role similar to trickbot, which includes malspam delivery, stealthy maldocs dropping signed loaders, establishing a foothold, and finally post exploitation activities such as lateral movement, access operations, and ransomware delivery. alien labs actively tracks the qakbot c2 infrastructure for customers, which is available via otx here.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by

which has been previously observed targeting exposed docker infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining purposes and credential theft. the group is using a new detection evasion tool, copied from open source repositories.the purpose of this blog\\xa0is to share new technical intelligence and provide detection and analysis options for defenders.at&t alien labs previously reported on teamtnt cryptomining malware using a new memory loader based on ezuri and written in golang. since then, teamtnt has added another tool to their list of capabilities.the objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.the tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on github, described as \"hide a process under linux using the ld preloader.\\'\\' preloading allows the system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. if the custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the system libraries, the custom version will override it.the tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.the new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the teamtnt cryptominer binary or ircbot (figure 1):figure 1. base64 encoded script, via alien labs analysis.upon binary execution, the bash script will run through a multitude of tasks. specifically, the script will:after decoding, we can observe the bash script functionality and how some malicious activity occurs before the shared library is created (figure 2):figure 2. decoded bash script, via alien labs analysis.the new tool is first dropped as a hidden tar file on disk, the script decompresses it, writes it to \\'/usr/local/lib/systemhealt.so\\', and then adds it preload via \\'/etc/ld.so.preload\\'. this will be used by the system to preload the file before other system libraries, allowing the attacker to override some common functions (figure 3/4).figure 3/4. bash script features, via alien labs analysis.the main purpose of the tool is to hide the teamtnt bot from process viewer tools, which use the file \\'/usr/bin/sbin\\' as you can see in figure 3 and 4 (setup_ircbot function).as final step, the malware will remove traces by deleting bash history:figure 5. bash script cleanup, via alien labs analysis.through the use of libprocesshider, teamtnt once again expands their capabilities based on the available open source tools. while the new functionality of libprocesshider is to evade detection and other basic functions, it acts as an indicator to consider when hunting for malicious activity on the host level. alien labs will continue to monitor the threat and report on any

            "{'titel': 'malware using new ezuri memory loader', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was written by ofer caspi and fernando martinez of at&t alien labsmultiple threat actors have recently started using a go language (golang) tool to act as a packer and avoid antivirus detection. additionally, the ezuri memory loader tool acts as a malware loader and executes its payload in memory, without writing the file to disk. while this technique is known and commonly used by windows malware, it is less popular in linux environments. the loader decrypts the malicious malware and executes it using memfd create (as described in this blog in 2018). when creating a process, the system returns a file descriptor to an anonymous file in \\'/proc/pid/fd/\\' which is visible only in the filesystem.figure 1 shows a code snippet from the loader, containing the information it uses in order to decrypt the payload using the aes algorithm. figure 1. loader code snippet via alien labs analysis.the loader, written in golang, is taken from the \"ezuri\" code on github via the user guitmz. this user originally created the elf loader around march 2019, when he wrote a blog about the technique to run elf executables from memory and shared the loader on his github. additionally, a similar user ‘tmz’ (presumably associated with the previously mentioned ‘guitmz’) posted this same code in late august, on a small forum where malware samples are shared.the guitmz user even ran tests against virustotal to prove the efficiency of the code, uploading a detected linux.cephei sample (35308b8b770d2d4f78299262f595a0769e55152cb432d0efc42292db01609a18) with 30/61 av detections in virustotal, compared to the zero av detections by the same sample hidden with the ezuri code (ddbb714157f2ef91c1ec350cdf1d1f545290967f61491404c81b4e6e52f5c41f).the execution flow of the loader is to first decrypt the payload and then execute it from memory (figure 2):figure 2. execution flow, retrieved from alien labs analysis.guitmz gave this sample the name ezuri, probably after the card with the same name from the card game “magic: the gathering.” \\xa0this card has the capability to “regenerate another target elf,” reflecting the \\xa0malware’s capability of loading and executing an elf file in memory.at&t alien labs team accessed guitmz’s upload of code for analysis. the tool is written in golang and is intuitive to use. when executing, it first asks the path for the payload to be encrypted, along with the password to be used for aes encryption. if no password is given, the tool generates one, which is used to hide the malware within the loader. after the user\\'s input, the packer compiles the loader with the payload encrypted within it, so it can be decrypted and executed in memory once it is placed in the victim’s system. figure 4 shows the main function of the executable, where the file is first decrypted by “aesdec” to then be run in memory by “runfrommemory”. figure 3 shows ezuri main function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.figure 4 shows the “runfrommemory” function used to execute the payload in memory without placing the detectable malware on disk.figure 4 shows ezuri runfrommemory function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.to use the tool, the user will be requested to enter the file to be hidden, with a target process name as well as an optional aes key for encryption (figure 5):figure 5 shows ezuri execution, retrieved from alien labs analysis.at&t alien labs has identified several malware authors leveraging the ezuri loader in the last few months, including teamtnt, which was the first identified. teamtnt is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least april 2020, when the security firm trend micro first reported on them. the main focus of the group is to target docker systems with misconfigurations, as well as unprotected and exposed management apis, to later install ddos bots and cryptominers in the infected systems. a few months after the trend micro report, in august 2020, cado security found new developments in the teamtnt group. in october 2020, palo alto networks unit42 identified new variants of the cryptomining malware used by teamtnt named “black-t.” this sample first installs three network scanners, and then inspects memory in an attempt to retrieve any type of credentials located in the memory. additionally, unit42 identified several german-language strings in some of the tnt scripts.the last sample identified by palo alto networks unit42 is actually an ezuri loader. the decrypted payload is an elf file packed with upx, which is a known sample from teamtnt, first seen in june 2020 (e15550481e89dbd154b875ce50cc5af4b49f9ff7b837d9ac5b5594e5d63966a3).the techniques and code similarities between the original tool, named ezuri, and the one recently used by teamtnt are vast. the most evident one being the \\'ezuri\\' string in the compiled binary (figure 6):figure 6 shows ezuri string in teamtnt\\xa0sample retrieved from alien labs analysis.using this packer, the antivirus (av) detection drops dramatically. looking at the teamtnt malware detections before using ezuri packer (b494ca3b7bae2ab9a5197b81e928baae5b8eac77dfdc7fe1223fee8f27024772), we see 28/62 av detections of the malware, while the ezuri packed version (751014e0154d219dea8c2e999714c32fd98f817782588cd7af355d2488eb1c80) drops to only 3/64 av detections.in addition to teamtnt, there were several gafgyt samples observed (popular iot device malware with ddos attacks purposes). several malware authors have been using an open source golang tool to act as a malware loader, using a known technique to load the elf binaries into memory and avoid using easy-to-detect files on disk. the authors use the open source tool ezuri, to load its previously seen payloads and avoid antivirus detections on the file. the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe

            "{'titel': 'trickbot bazarloader in depth', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsofer caspi, a fellow alien labs researcher, co-authored this blog.at&t alien labs actively tracks the trickbot group through an automated malware analysis system, hunting, and in-depth technical research. on april 20th, 2020 independent security researchers “pancak3lullz” (@pancak3lullz) and vitali kremez (@vk_intel) posted a tweet regarding two new trickbot modules aptly named “bazarloader” and “bazarbackdoor” after attempted command and control (c2) communications with the emercoin dns (emerdns) .bazar domains. emerdns is desirable for attackers because it is a distributed blockchain that is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. alien labs’ automated malware analysis engine had picked up these samples a few days earlier (ex: 7c93d9175a38c23d44d76d9a883f7f3da1e244c2ab6c3ac9f29a9c9e20d20a5f)bleepingcomputer posted a blog with input from vitali kremez regarding a phishing campaign distributed through the sendgrid email marketing platform delivering covid-19 lures that ultimately led to the trickbot bazarbackdoor. the purpose of this blog is to provide additional technical details and an in-depth study of the signed trickbot bazarloader.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0since trickbot was discovered in 2016 it has been involved in information stealing, credential theft, ransomware, bitcoin mining, and loading other common crimeware malware as a first or second stage loader. for initial access as a first stage loader it typically accomplishes its objective through spear phishing links (t1192) or spear phishing attachments (t1193) using macro enabled microsoft office files. as a second stage payload and dynamic link library (dll) it is frequently loaded by emotet. to a lesser extent trickbot has been loaded by ostap javascript downloader and buer loader. in higher priority, higher profile trickbot anchor campaigns that target enterprises, powertrick and more_eggs/terraloader have been used to load other frameworks.trickbot has recently added a remote desktop protocol (rdp) brute force scanner module, an active directory (ad) harvesting module, and the mexec executor module. there are some indications that trickbot may be moving away from their mshare, mworm, and tabdll modules for retrieving payloads from urls in favor of the “nworm” module performing this task. it is important to note that trickbot group prefers to use shellcode “file-less” modules making detection more difficult.alien labs has previously identified digitally signed trickbot loaders, one of which was signed by an entity named “vb corporate pty. ltd.” pivoting in virustotal on the signer shows the first submission was on 2020-01-02 20:24:57. historically, the trickbot group has continued to reuse their revoked certificates to sign trickbot loaders as long as six months after the initial date of detection on virustotal. a list of known trickbot signers is included below. the associated signature serial numbers are included in the yara rule in the appendix.the trickbot bazarloader authors have produced an advanced module, with a significant amount of obfuscation. the bazarloader/cryptor uses multiple routines to hide api calls and embedded strings, which are then decrypted and resolved at runtime. once executed, the loader will allocate memory to store and decrypt its shellcode, which will be allocated to a numa node for faster execution. after allocation and decryption, the next instructions will jump to the shellcode that will be executed on the heap.next, the malware will try to communicate with .bazar domain c2 servers. once the c2 has been established, the loader will try to inject its payload into a system process using the process hollowing technique (t1093), which will create a suspended thread, unmap the destination image from memory, allocate new memory in the target process, copy the shellcode into the target process, set the thread context, and resume the process. in the sample analyzed, 1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83, the loader will first attempt to inject into an “svchost” process, and if injection fails, it will try to inject into the “explorer.exe” process, and if injection fails again as a last-ditch effort the loader will attempt to inject into the “cmd.exe” process. for persistence the loader will create a registry key under “hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\winlogon\\\\userinit”.the malware uses the windows api “virtualallocexnuma” function to allocate memory for its shellcode to be executed. the “virtualallocexnuma” function is used to allocate memory on a numa node, which allows for faster execution. the implementation can be seen in figure 1 below. it is interesting to note that the “virtualallocexnuma” function is not commonly used in process injection.figure 1. api resolution and shellcode decryption routinesin figure 1 above the bazarloader allocates memory using the uncommon “virtualallocexnuma” routine, and then it uses two iterations of the decryption routine to decrypt its shellcode. in the second call to the decrypt function some of the encryption key bytes are changed based on function parameters. in figure 2 below a representation of the decompiled decrypt routine can be seen importing the encryption key, modifying the encryption key bytes dependent on the parameters passed, and then decrypting the data.figure 2. decryption routinethe bazarloader authors have created dozens of decryption routines, and with almost each string including apis, dlls, and c2s there is a once per use unique decryption routine. an example of multiple decryption routines can be seen in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 below.figure 3. decryption routinefigure 4. decryption routinefigure 5. decryption routinethe loader uses the same decryption technique described above to resolve the api calls it uses during execution. the windows api resolution can be seen in figure 6 below.figure 6. windows api resolutionfor injection, the malware resolves apis from the ntdll.dll after it loads from disk and checks that there are no inline hooks within its function, that could be created for example by av software that tracks those api calls.the targeted processes for injection can be seen in figure 7 below.figure 7. targeted svchost, explorer, and cmd windows processes\\xa0the bazarloader injection code can be seen

            "{'titel': 'a hipaa compliance checklist', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsmaintaining security and compliance with hipaa, the health insurance portability and accountability act, is growing ever more challenging. the networks that house protected health information (phi or ephi) are becoming larger and more complex — especially as organizations move data to the cloud. at the same time, security professionals are faced with an evolving threat landscape of increasingly sophisticated threat actors and methods of attack.for example, 2018 threat intelligence research by at&t alien\\xa0labs reports a rise in the number of targeted ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. these attacks are often backed by organized criminals who see opportunities for making money from health care providers and other similar entities who must protect and keep assets, systems, and networks continuously operating.one such criminal group operating the samsam ransomware is thought to have earned more than $5 million dollars by manually compromising critical healthcare networks. and, according to alienvault labs, the methods used by samsam are more akin to a targeted attack than typical opportunistic ransomware.to help address these security challenges and ensure adherence to compliance mandates, security and it professionals should consider how people, processes, and technology can be used together to create a holistic it security compliance program that simplifies preparation, auditing and reporting, as well as ongoing security risk management and breach monitoring and response. here’s a five-step hipaa compliance checklist to get started.certification and ongoing hipaa compliancehipaa sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. any entity that deals with protected health information must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. in 2009, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act was adopted to promote the “meaningful use of health information technology” and address the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information. although there is no standard or implementation specification that requires a covered entity to “certify” compliance, the evaluation standard § 164.308(a)(8) requires covered entities to perform ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations that establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements. evaluations can be performed and documented internally or by an external organization that provides evaluation or “certification” services. however, hitech requires the hhs office for civil rights (ocr) to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the hipaa privacy, security, and breach notification rules.step 1: start with a comprehensive risk assessment and gap analysisyour compliance strategy should start with a solid foundation, which is why the first step in your journey to hipaa compliance should be a readiness assessment that includes a comprehensive risk and compliance analysis of your electronic health record (ehr) environment. this assessment is often best done by a third party with expertise in healthcare security and compliance, as hipaa regulations can be confusing and cumbersome. using a third party with the necessary expertise will ensure you don’t miss or misunderstand the required regulations, and it will save you time as they will likely have a hipaa checklist to reference.\\xa0your consultant can perform an initial evaluation of your entire security program to determine its adherence to hipaa regulations and the level of readiness to proceed with the “certification” process. it’s worth noting that the ocr does not actually “certify” hipaa compliance (see side bar), however there are organizations outside of the ocr that do provide “certification” services, and many organizations take advantage of these certification services to prove compliance. as a result of the evaluation, your consultant should provide a comprehensive report that may include such things as:according to the ocr, organizations that have aligned their security programs to the national institute for standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework may find it helpful as a starting place to identify potential gaps in their compliance with the hipaa security rule. addressing these gaps can bolster compliance with the security rule and improve the organization’s ability to secure ephi and other critical information and business processes. read how nist “maps” to the hipaa security rule in the hipaa security rule crosswalk to nist cybersecurity framework.step 2: remediate identified risks and address compliance gapsonce you’ve identified your organization’s risks, take immediate steps to address the gaps within your security program. again, a consultant who has practical experience in healthcare security will be very useful in providing strategic guidance, as well as advice on risk mitigation. many organizations use the same consultant who performed their initial risk assessment.your consultant may develop specific programs, policies, standards, and procedures, as well as support or help implement key security practices and controls. for example, they may assist in prioritizing vulnerabilities and make recommendations for remediation in your ehr environment. or, they may provide pre-packaged employee security awareness training that meets hipaa guidelines, such as educating employees on security risks and running them through attack scenarios.make use of security technology to help you more quickly address the gaps in your compliance program — and consider platforms versus point solutions, giving you the ability to address multiple issues at once. also, look for solutions that address both on-premises and multi-cloud environments as hipaa regulations apply to both (see guidance on hipaa & cloud computing).\\xa0for example, look for such use cases as the automation of asset discovery and the ability to categorize those assets into hipaa groups for easy management and reporting. those same solutions may also perform vulnerability assessments, automate the prioritization of vulnerabilities for mitigation, and integrate with ticketing solutions to ensure the most critical are being remediated while overall risks are mitigated.step 3: take advantage of automated compliance reportingthe evaluation standard of hipaa requires covered entities to perform and document ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations to establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements.most solutions do not cover all the requirements defined by the hipaa audit protocol, but they will give you a jump on your hipaa checklist.many security management platforms also include additional predefined event reports, such as reports by data source and data source type, helping to make daily compliance monitoring and reporting activities more efficient.also, look for an intuitive and flexible interface that allows you to quickly search and analyze your security data, as well as the ability to create and save custom views and export them as executive-ready reports.finally, solutions that provide centralized visibility of your cloud and on-premises assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and log data from firewalls and other security tools are key to giving you the most complete and contextual data set for maintaining and documenting continuous compliance.step 4: implement monitoring and breach notification protocolsthe breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and business associates to provide notifications if they experience a breach that involves unsecured protected health information.security management platforms can help to simplify and automate monitoring for breaches on your network, ensuring you are able to more quickly detect and contain a breach, as well as provide the required notifications.as more organizations in healthcare are migrating data and applications to the cloud, make sure the technology you’re choosing offers advanced threat detection across both on-premises and multi-cloud environments. simplify compliance management by choosing a solution that combines an array of essential security capabilities in one platform. these may include, but are not limited to: asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, endpoint detection and response, siem event correlation, file integrity monitoring (fim), and log management. by combining these use cases in a single dashboard, you are better able to quickly identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats that target your ehr environment.intelligence it key to threat detection and incident response, so consider vendors who have in-house research teams as well as access to external threat intelligence communities and other sources that can provide insight into the latest global threats and vulnerabilities — and in particular, those that are specific to healthcare.however, intelligence without context will create lot of distracting “noise” for your team. so, check that the solution goes beyond just providing intelligence to incorporating it directly into your dashboard, including providing recommendations on how to respond to identified threats. with this intelligence and guidance at your fingertips, you can react quickly to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. and, you are assured of an always-up-to-date and optimally performing security monitoring solution.need more info on how to respond to a breach? see the hhs quick response checklist.step 5: continuously evaluate and manage riskwhether you are managing ongoing hipaa compliance internally or are using an external organization, avoid last-minute scrambling for annual evaluations and audits by employing a year-round risk management program. such a program requires having real-time visibility of your environment, including system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall information, and product upgrades.use a unified platform to gain this visibility and enable monitoring in a central location (opposed to various point solutions). here are a few examples of where a platform would be helpful for continuous risk and compliance management:examples: use automated asset discovery for on-premises and cloud environments and then create asset groups such as business critical assets or hipaa assets for ongoing monitoring, management and reporting. identify systems with known vulnerabilities and use correlation rules to detect threats.examples: monitor for successful and failed logon events to assets. monitor for communications with known malicious ip addresses or use file integrity monitoring (fim) to detect, assess and report on changes to system binaries, and content locations. schedule vulnerability scans, automate assessments, and plan for mitigation. review events and detected incidents.examples: aggregate events from across on-premises and multi-cloud environments. classify threats based on their risk level. monitor for stolen credentials, malware-based compromises such as communication to a known command and control (c&c) server, anomalous user and admin activities, file integrity, and vulnerabilities.example: automate forensics tasks to be executed in response to a detected threat and simplify forensics investigations with filters, search and reporting capabilities for event and log data. automate actions to contain threats, such as isolating systems from the network.use out-of-the box reporting to document that you’ve made an accurate assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic phi — and to quickly show the status of technical controls that align to hipaa or other regulations.maintaining adherence to hipaa is no small feat considering the dozens of criteria that are considered in the hipaa audit checklist. attempting to manage your compliance program manually and without the help of expert healthcare security consultants will not only take up massive amounts of time, it could result in your team missing an essential component of the regulation, or worse yet, enduring a breach that compromises patient data or takes down the network. however, with the right mix of people, processes and technology, it’s not an impossible to stay on top of compliance management while ensuring your network is secure and patient data protected year-round.hipaa regulationshipaa privacy rule: this rule set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by three types of covered entities: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and health care providers who conduct the standard healthcare transactions electronically.\\xa0hipaa security rule: this rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic

            "{'titel': 'malware hosting domain cyberium fanning out mirai variants', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs has observed the mirai variant botnet, known as moobot, scanning for known but uncommon vulnerabilities in tenda routers, resulting in a considerable peak in our internal telemetry. the research associated with this peak resulted in the discovery of a malware hosting domain, providing several different mirai variants, like moobot and satori.key points:during the end of march, at&t alien labs observed a spike in exploitation attempts for tenda remote code execution (rce) vulnerability cve-2020-10987. this spike was observed throughout a significant number of clients, in the space of a few hours. this vulnerability is not commonly used by web scanners and was barely detected by our honeypots during the last six months, except for a minor peak in november.this exploit can be identified by the url that is requested, which includes ‘setusbunload’ with the payload assigned to the vulnerable parameter ‘devicename’. this payload contains the logic to change the execution path to a temporary location, wget a file from a malware hosting page, provide execution permissions, and execute it.figure 1. binaryedge sensor detecting the vulnerability scan.following this thread, a single actor was identified to be behind these scans in late march — at the time, the actor appeared to have no previous activity. the scan for tenda vulnerable routers only lasted one day, but the scanning activity continued for several weeks, including the below vulnerabilities:some of these exploit attempts were captured by honeypots. all of them appeared to be pulling their next iteration of the malware from the same malware hosting page: dns.cyberium[.]cc.when this domain was investigated, several campaigns were identified, going back at least one year to may 2020. most of the attacks lasted for approximately a week while they hosted several mirai variants, after which they left the subdomain unresolvable. however, this seems to be the behavior of the threat actor in between operations. the actors appear to come back to the same domain with a new subdomain for each new campaign. activity in between campaigns goes quiet to increase the trust of the original domain. keeping a long-running existing domain while issuing brand new one domain helps to divert attention to the new domain and thus distract from the original.figure 2. riskiq heatmap of cyberium[.]cc.the full list of subdomains/campaigns identified from this domain is:we were able to identify other infrastructure that we assess with high confidence is controlled by the same actor and has been used as moobot command and control in the past.all of the domains use the same:the first request to these malware hosting pages was for a bash script, which aimed to download later stages of the malware. as seen in the screenshot below, the script attempts to download a list of filenames (associated with different cpu architectures), executes each one of them, achieves persistence through a crontab that redownloads the bash script itself, and finally deletes itself.figure 3. tenda downloader script.this script is very similar to downloaders previously seen for mirai variants. the minor modifications appear to be on the downloading server, persistence methods (if any) and the filename, usually named after the vulnerable device vendor.during the time this domain was available and delivering malware, at least three different variants of mirai were identified: moobot, satori/fbot, and other samples unassociated with these botnets. one of the peculiarities of this domain was how it juggled between mirai variants, even under the same filenames. the same url could be hosting satori one day and moobot the week after.in october 2020, lacework\\xa0reported on a new mirai variant called moobot. this variant mainly chased exposed and vulnerable dockers apis to include them into their ddos botnet. one of the main distinctions of this variant has been a hardcoded string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, compared to the mirai source code which used the string “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw012345678” as a seed to generate an alphanumeric string. this random string is used several times throughout the code, one of them to generate the process name to be used during execution.many samples available at cyberium contained the above-mentioned string and this domain was already being used to distribute this botnet when lacework first reported on it. however, the number of samples alien labs has seen with that string has greatly increased in the last months, scattering from the original moobot sample. this could potentially mean that last year\\'s moobots samples were used to create new branches of mirai variants.unlike some other mirai variants, the samples obtained from moobot were encrypted, attempting to evade string-based detection, static analysis of the exploits used, or after compromised activities. however, it did maintain other previously seen characteristics, like a hardcoded list of ip addresses\\xa0to avoid, such as: private ranges, the department of defense, iana ips, ge, hp and others.figure 4. moobot’s ip scan restrictions.the malware writers appear to be very aware of who they’re potential victims are. for this reason, the malware will try to hide its process name by changing it using prctl. the covert process name is “/var/sofia”, which is the name of a video application on the targeted devices.figure 5. moobot process hideout.right after hiding the process, this sample will print to screen the string “9xsspnvgc8aj5pi7m28p” which has been associated with different mirai variants over time (fbot\\xa0and gafgyt). however, it appears this is a passed down characteristic through variant versions, like previously seen with “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f”, but this time there aren’t any shared iocs with previous attackers.after successful infection, the payload attempts to query the hardcoded c2 on port 12028 to get a list of c2. at the time of study, the cyberium domain was down, and these communications couldn’t be analyzed.early in march 2021, the same links previously mentioned for moobot, for example dns.cyberium[.]cc/arm, were actually providing samples for satori. the satori botnet, also known as fbot, is yet another mirai variant based botnet. unexpectedly, these samples were mingled with other unix botnets in the same malware hosting server.the similarities between moobot and satori samples are vast, since they both are coming from the same mirai source code. these similarities include:the most noteworthy differences observed were:additional samples were identified under the same domain, which on a first investigation appeared to be a mix between the already mentioned moobot and satori samples with a random combination of their characteristics. most of them looked like moobot samples without the encoding or satori without the hardcoded domain.however, the samples are not associated with the current domain under study, probably because it is being left fallow. after pivoting on the scanning ip, delivering the downloaders scripts, it is currently providing the same script with an updated temporary domain, which is currently delivering additional satori/fbot samples packed with upx.alien labs has identified the cyberium malware hosting domain to be providing many different mirai variants, like moobot or satori, during the last year. actors have been jumping between subdomains to recycle their infrastructure as most as possible. at the time of publishing this blog (may 2021) some of the cyberium subdomains were up, but they were not hosting any malware samples. they could be potentially awaiting new requests for c2 lists.several questions remain unanswered. why would the attackers deliver different mirai variants with different c2s on the same campaign? and, are they trying to avoid anti-virus detection through diversification of variants? or, are they trying to improve the botnet resiliency by diversifying c2.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.suricata ids signaturesalert http $external_net any -> $home_net any (msg:\"av exploit tenda router rce (cve-2020-10987)\"; flow:to_server,established;

            "{'titel': 'securing aws policies', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsaws policies are a key foundation in good cloud security, but they are often overlooked. in this blog, we take a quick look on some aws policies, particularly for\\xa0identity and access management\\xa0(iam), that could become problematic if not properly managed. we'll discuss how they can be used against us to generate attacks like: ransomware, data exfiltration, credential abuse, and more. finally, we'll suggest some open source tools for cloud policy assessment and pentesting.\\xa0\\xa0the first step in achieving good security is having effective policies to regulate what can and cannot be done in an environment, both physical devices and cloud infrastructure. these regulatory policies are frequently hard to define and keep up-to-date, especially in a fast-paced environment using infrastructure-as-a-service (iaas). this blog looks at some changes in policies\\xa0which can reduce success in some common attack types involving: exfiltration, ransomware, credential abuse, and more. for that reason, at&t alien labs is sharing an easy ‘what to look for’ list in order to detect some red flags in aws policy changes. it is our hope that this\\xa0list will be helpful\\xa0for security analysts and forensic investigators.policies are spoiler alert, defined by aws policies, which define permissions for identities and resources. every time\\xa0aws identity and access management makes a request of any kind to a resource, a policy determines if the iam is allowed or denied access to that specific resource under the policies for the involved parties.a full understanding of aws policies (types, creation, enforcement, etc.) is outside the scope of this\\xa0blog, but it can be found in aws documentation.people implementing aws policies should have knowledge of the organization, adapting\\xa0policies to needs of the business. afterwards, detection rules should be generated\\xa0for red flags in cloudtrail or other security tools. by doing this, we are avoiding policy changes in a generic manner, for example using ‘*’ to cover the whole principal without setting any conditions to it (mfa, ip, usernames, etc.). the problem resides in changes occurring on a daily basis to the policies, which are often overlooked by analysts. the impact that these changes could have\\xa0is as big as any other event or alert investigated.in order to classify all aws actions involving a policy change that could be used by attackers, we’ll sort them based on the potential final attack type. most of the following techniques would fall under modify cloud compute infrastructure (t1578) but we have attempted to classify them outside of their specific cloud technique - as if the activity was happening in a traditional environment.endpoint denial of service (t1499): adversaries may perform endpoint dos attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. this blockage could be used as an additional impact on top of data encrypted for impact (t1486) to avoid or slow down\\xa0recovery efforts in a ransomware attack. in this scenario, attackers could be trying to block access to several aws resources like: s3, ec2 through efs or ebs, or backups between others.s3: amazon’s storage service can suffer a dos by adding policies that block access to its contents. buckets and access points are both s3 resources that could be impacted by an excessively restrictive policy or access control list (acl), hence their relevance.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:denyaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)additionally, the events deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicy would have a similar effect, since they would be removing the policies where the public access is allowed.detection guidance:event/command:deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicyguardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)in a similar situation, amazon’s elastic file system (efs): any policy change denying access to this storage solution\\xa0could also lead to a dos. due to this, these\\xa0events and resource policies should be closely observed.detection guidance:event/commandputfilesystempolicyeffectdenyactionelasticfilesystem:clientmount or elasticfilesystem:clientwriteguardduty alert-indicator removal on host (t1070): adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files, such as quarantined malware. in this case, removed indicators not only affect the host, but the whole cloud and the log ingestion platform in charge of generating alerts. the main affected resource is cloudwatch, but there are others too.cloudwatch is\\xa0the monitoring service for aws resources\\xa0tracks logs coming from different resources and accounts in aws. blocking the logging access to resources would have a similar effect as deleting logs in a traditional computer.putresourcepolicy gives permission for other aws services to put log events to the current account. a new policy with effect deny on all\\xa0could avoid resources logging on their expected log file, and delay alerting on a detection. additionally, putdestinationpolicy has a similar\\xa0behavior - it has the capability of creating an access policy for existing log destinations. a restrictive policy could lead to a logs not being in the expected log location. in this case, putresourcepolicy api or cli does not allow specifying * as the principal, and each sender account must be listed separately in the policy.several guardduty finding types could notify of any policy log tampering that could impact detection of indicators.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicy or putdestinationpolicyeffect:denyaction:logs:*guardduty alert:stealth:s3/serveraccessloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/cloudtrailloggingdisabled orstealth:iamuser/loggingconfigurationmodifiedother log events could be of relevance, like putretentionpolicy, but none of their effects would be as drastic as the previously mentioned or are not strictly determined by policies.inhibit system recovery (t1490): blocking access to the backups or modifying permissions to delete them, most likely with ransomware intentions.efs offers an automatic backup system through the command putbackuppolicy, which could be disabled in a ransomware scenario causing slower recovery efforts.detection guidance:event/command:putbackuppolicystatus:disabledbackups: aws offers several solutions for backing up systems (as we have already seen with the efs solution). looking into the aws backup official solution and disabling it or removing permissions to access them has the direct impact of a dos, and aggravates the ransomware scenario.detection guidance:event/command:putbackupvaultaccesspolicyeffect:denyallowaction:backup:*backup:delete*guardduty alert:-exfiltration over web service (t1567): exposes current resources to the internet with the intention of exfiltrating data outside of the organization.s3: as we saw in the dos section, a change in policies could remove public internet access to a bucket or access point. in this situation we are looking at the opposite scenario, a private s3 being made public to leverage it for exfiltration purposes.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:allowaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/bucketpublicaccessgranted or policy:s3/bucketanonymousaccessgrantedelasticsearch: if the domain associated with an elasticsearch instance is public, an attacker could modify any existing condition, like ip addresses\\xa0or command restrictions - to increase the actions that can be performed on this public domain. aws does not have a specific command to modify its access policies for elasticsearch, but they can be modified from the user interface or the api through the domain config, on an individual domain basis.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:es:* (in particular es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig)guardduty alert:-attackers could also create a new elasticsearch domain and include the above-mentioned policies. it is outside the scope of this blog to discuss\\xa0operations involving new resources to exfiltrate data (elasticsearch, s3, efs, etc.). this attack would become noisier, since it involves creating new resources, applying the mentioned policies, and copying any relevant data to these resources. just for reference, this attack would classify as transfer data to cloud account (t1537).elastic container registry (ecr): provides the capability to store docker containers and have them ready for deployment. this deployment availability can also be turned around and be used for exfiltration by\\xa0downloading docker containers from a pre-signed amazon s3 download url. this privilege can be obtained by modifying the setrepositorypolicy for the corresponding ecr and allowing the action getdownloadurlforlayer to access it externally.detection guidance:event/command:setrepositorypolicy or putrepositorypolicyeffect:allowaction:ecr:getdownloadurlforlayerguardduty alert:-os credential dumping (t1003): uses a lack of security to dump credentials either encrypted, hashed or in clear text, to use them later in towards lateral movement or accessing confidential information.aws secrets manager is a great example of a target for a credential access scenario. the secrets in this vault need to be accessed by internal or external resources eventually, and a bad security policy might allow an attacker to take those credentials. these might be encrypted with a kms key, but attackers would still be one step closer to their their goal.an escalation of privileges (or decrease in security) could be achieved through the putresourcepolicy for secretsmanager. an excess of allowed privileges could make credential access easier.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:secretsmanager:* (in particular getsecretvalue)guardduty alert:-aws key management service (kms): is amazon’s key manager to control what users and applications have access to certain cryptographic keys. access to these keys is, as you can expect at this point of the blog, given by a specific policy. changes made to this policy can enable\\xa0several different attacks (like a dos if access is denied to all users), but in this case we are looking at a too permissive policy set with putkeypolicy.detection guidance:event/command:putresourcepolicyeffect:allowaction:kms:putkeypolicyguardduty alert:-in addition to the already mentioned events and aws resources, there are others that could be leveraged by attackers, but these fall out of the scope of this blog to keep it a\\xa0reasonable length. just to mention some of these - they would be: amazon simple queue service (sqs) through sqs:addpermission, amazon simple notification service (amazon sns) through sns:addpermission, aws elemental mediastore through putcontainerpolicy, aws lambda through lambda:addpermission, etc.after analyzing some of the most relevant policy changes impacting the cloud environment’s security in your organization, we’ll take a look at some of the aws penetration testing tools available for free, and how they use\\xa0policies.aws offers an access analyzer capable of assessing existing resource-based policies, and focuses on identifying any resources shared with external entities. amazon refers to an external entity as any other aws account, root user, iam user or role, federated user, aws service, anonymous user, or other entity.it is a great resource for some critical resources like s3, kms or secretmanager. however, it lacks coverage to other resources that could be as important, like elasticsearch domains or cloudwatch resource policies.this free cloud pentesting tool provides a deep test of existing policies in aws. the only prerequisite is an aws api credential with privileges to update resource policies. it is capable of running in ‘expose’ mode, modifying just the necessary resources to achieve a backdoor, or ‘smash’ mode, revealing potential security concerns by: enumerating resources, reading and modifying current policies, and finally implanting as many backdoors as possible through weaknesses in the victim’s iam security policies.it offers approximately 30% more coverage than aws iam access analyzer, including coverage for:in the full list of policies required to achieve all the backdoors included with the tool, we can see some policies already mentioned in this blog: ecr:setrepositorypolicy, elasticfilesystem:putfilesystempolicy, es:updateelasticsearchdomainconfig, kms:putkeypolicy, lambda:addpermission, logs:putresourcepolicy, s3:putbucketpolicy, secretsmanager:putresourcepolicy.cloudsplaining performs a deep assessment on all the aws iam security policies and identifies violations of least privilege, producing a full html report. the report includes triage items as well as remediation indications, offering the user a very helpful resource to analyze their current configuration and offering improvement possibilities.hacking the cloud is an online encyclopedia supported by volunteers. the webpage contains a list of attacks/tactics/techniques that offensive security professionals can use to pentest their cloud environments. the attacks are not very policy focused, but it does use them in some attacks, like in the “unauthenticated enumeration of iam users and roles”, which is present in pacu too.there are many other open source useful tools for cloud pentesting or policy assessment, like: parliament, pacu, pmapper, repokid, policy sentry.in this blog we have seen several attacks\\xa0that\\xa0could be performed using aws policies - especially if they weren’t properly set up. we've discussed\\xa0the\\xa0importance of aws policies as the foundation of a good cloud security. we have seen how guardduty detects some dangerous policy changes, but leaves out many others that can only be detected through constantly reviewing\\xa0cloudtrail logs. the pentesting tools seen in the blog can help detect holes in the policies. an alternative solution is the use of siems like usm anywhere, with specific detection rules added on a daily basis, thanks to the threat content that the at&t alien labs team adds to the usm anywhere platform.aws policies: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/latest/userguide/access_policies.htmlendgame: https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latestcloudsplaining: https://github.com/salesforce/cloudsplaininghacking the cloud: https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/general-knowledge/connection-tracking/parliament: https://github.com/duo-labs/parliamentpacu: https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/pacu-open-source-aws-exploitation-framework/pmapper: https://github.com/nccgroup/pmapperrepokid: https://github.com/netflix/repokidpolicy sentry: https://github.com/salesforce/policy_sentry/the findings of this report are mapped to the following mitre att&ck matrix techniques:tags: ransomware, cloud security, attacks, labs, iam, aws security, open source, aws policyinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.\"}\n",

active since 2007 and primarily used by financially motivated actors. it was initially known as a banking trojan and a loader using c2 servers for payload delivery; however, its use expanded beyond strictly being a banking trojan. the hallmarks of a qakbot infection chain consist of a phishing lure (t1566) delivered via email chain hijacking or spoofed emails that contain context-aware information such as shipping, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, claims, etc. the phishing emails alternate between file attachments (t1566.001) and links (t1566.002). qakbot is often used as a gateway entry, similar to trickbot or emotet, that leads to post exploitation operations leveraging frameworks such as cobalt strike as well as delivering ransomware.qakbot email lures are not the most sophisticated; however, by using contextually aware themes that originate from hijacked email chains or potentially compromised accounts within a user’s social circle, they are effective. figure 1 below illustrates an example of a recent qakbot lure with the subject “re: signed quote” and a zip file attachment labeled “cancellation_letter_272020508-02242021.zip”.figure 1. qakbot \"signed quote\" email lurethe actors further establish the trust and confidence of the targeted user by presenting a semi-official looking docusign graphic that guides the user through the process of enabling the excel 4 macros. a representative sample, 78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a, seen in a recent qakbot campaign is shown in figure 2 below.figure 2. qakbot docusign lureqakbot excel spreadsheets often contain hidden spreadsheets, excel 4.0 macros, spreadsheet formulas, and biff records all designed to pass a visual inspection from the user with the added benefit of bypassing detection mechanisms that attempt to parse multiple legacy formats inside the spreadsheet. figure 3 below shows a screenshot of output from the open-source xlmmacrodeobfuscator tool, which decodes obfuscated excel 4.0 macros.figure 3. xlmmacrodeobfuscator output for a qakbot excel 4.0 macro spreadsheetonce the excel 4.0 macro is decoded it is possible to see the call to urldownloadtofilea, which downloads the qakbot dll in this campaign from http[:]//rlyrt26rnxw02vqijgs[.]com/fera/frid[.]gif. next, the exec function is evaluated which executes “rundll32.exe nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver”. it is also a common tactic for qakbot to execute “regsvr32.exe -s nxckew.wle,dllregisterserver”. both instances are designed to evade sandbox environments that do not supply the expected command line arguments. a representative qakbot dll analyzed by alien labs, 9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28, has two exports: the entry point (0x10005a5d) and dllregisterserver (0x10029c88)and if dllregisterserver is not called via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe with command line options, then only the entry point is called and the malicious code in dllregisterserver is not called. figure 3 below shows improved readability and de-obfuscation of the macro by manually replacing and substituting the cell values and formulas.figure 3. better de-obfuscation of the spreadsheetthe results of our additional de-obfuscation efforts are confirmed when the qakbot excel spreadsheet is run inside a sandbox in figure 4 below.figure 4. otx screenshot showing the “rundll32 ..\\\\nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver\\'\\' executionbefore executing the main payload, the qakbot loader will first test the infected system to see if it is a good candidate for infection. the qakbot loader is responsible for checking its environment to include whether it is running on a virtual machine, identifying any installed and running security and monitoring tools such as antivirus products or common security researcher tools. figure 5 below shows a high-level execution flow of the qakbot loader.figure 5. qakbot execution flowto make detection and analysis harder, qakbot encrypts its strings and decrypts them at runtime before use. once the qakbot execution logic is finished using a string, it will immediately delete the string from memory. an example of this can be seen in figure 6 below, which shows qakbot decrypting a string containing the value for lpprocname passed as a parameter to the getprocaddress api call. the selected function, which has been labeled in ida pro as, “oc_clear_mem” deletes the string memory right after it retrieves the process address.figure 6. qakbot getprocaddress and clear_mem routineswhen executed, qakbot will check whether it has previously been executed on the machine by checking for the specified malware folder. if qakbot discovers it is a first time run, it will relaunch itself from cmd.exe with the /c parameter that will inform the loader to proceed and run its anti-vm checks on the machine and return the results to the parent process. if qakbot detects it is running in a vm environment, then the final payload will not be decrypted since qakbot uses the return value from these checks in its final decryption routine. figure 7 below shows the qakbot environment check logic.figure 7. qakbot environment check logicspecifically, qakbot checks the system for the names of running processes that match the strings listed in table 1 below.process namesfigure 8 below shows the decryption routine for the security and monitoring tool strings (t1140).figure 8. qakbot decrypting tool check stringsqakbot will also add its folder to the windows defender exclusions setting located in the registry (t1112), which prevents defender from scanning qakbot artifacts. the registry location can be seen in figure 9 below.figure 9. qakbot adding exclusion paths to windows defender settingsin addition to the previously mentioned environment check, qakbot collects system information (t1082) such as computer name, system directories, user profiles, and more, which is shown in figure 10 below.figure 10. qakbot system information collectionqakbot will use process hollowing (t1055.012) in order to inject itself into explorer.exe. if it is unsuccessful then qakbot will attempt to inject itself into mobsync.exe or iexplore.exe. the screen shot in figure 11 illustrates the qakbot process name decryption routine.\\xa0figure 11. qakbot routine to decrypt process names for injectionfigure 12 below shows the qakbot logic to overwrite the suspended explorer.exe process and then resume its execution.figure 12. qakbot process hollowing routineadditionally, qakbot abuses the service control manager (scm) to create a child process, which is then detached from the parent when the scm terminates the parent process. qakbot c2 communications begin in this stage to make it more difficult to monitor. figure 13 below shows the scm spawned process abuse technique.figure 13. qakbot abusing scm to spawn a detached processfigure 14 below shows the qakbot c2 ping during the scm interaction.figure 14. qakbot sending c2 pingfinally, if the qakbot loader has verified its execution environment has passed its tests, then qakbot will proceed to decrypt and execute the main qakbot payload, which is hidden as resource “307”. the decryption and import table resolution of its main payload is shown in figure 15 below.figure 15. qakbot decryption and import table resolution of main payloadthe combined anti-analysis and evasion techniques across the infection chain significantly impair antivirus, edr, and other security defenses from detecting and preventing the initial infection. despite the limitations and challenges presented by qakbot dlls there is ample opportunity to detect qakbot loaders signed by revoked and blacklisted malicious certificates. alien labs has identified 42 unique signers and signature serial numbers, which are included in detection methods section to aid in detection and hunting with yara and osquery. additionally, there are a number of behavioral patterns, indicators of behavior (iob), which provide opportunities for detection.alien labs has observed qakbot over the past three months being used in a role similar to trickbot, which includes malspam delivery, stealthy maldocs dropping signed loaders, establishing a foothold, and finally post exploitation activities such as lateral movement, access operations, and ransomware delivery. alien labs actively tracks the qakbot c2 infrastructure for customers, which is available via otx here.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by

which has been previously observed targeting exposed docker infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining purposes and credential theft. the group is using a new detection evasion tool, copied from open source repositories.the purpose of this blog\\xa0is to share new technical intelligence and provide detection and analysis options for defenders.at&t alien labs previously reported on teamtnt cryptomining malware using a new memory loader based on ezuri and written in golang. since then, teamtnt has added another tool to their list of capabilities.the objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.the tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on github, described as \"hide a process under linux using the ld preloader.\\'\\' preloading allows the system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. if the custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the system libraries, the custom version will override it.the tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.the new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the teamtnt cryptominer binary or ircbot (figure 1):figure 1. base64 encoded script, via alien labs analysis.upon binary execution, the bash script will run through a multitude of tasks. specifically, the script will:after decoding, we can observe the bash script functionality and how some malicious activity occurs before the shared library is created (figure 2):figure 2. decoded bash script, via alien labs analysis.the new tool is first dropped as a hidden tar file on disk, the script decompresses it, writes it to \\'/usr/local/lib/systemhealt.so\\', and then adds it preload via \\'/etc/ld.so.preload\\'. this will be used by the system to preload the file before other system libraries, allowing the attacker to override some common functions (figure 3/4).figure 3/4. bash script features, via alien labs analysis.the main purpose of the tool is to hide the teamtnt bot from process viewer tools, which use the file \\'/usr/bin/sbin\\' as you can see in figure 3 and 4 (setup_ircbot function).as final step, the malware will remove traces by deleting bash history:figure 5. bash script cleanup, via alien labs analysis.through the use of libprocesshider, teamtnt once again expands their capabilities based on the available open source tools. while the new functionality of libprocesshider is to evade detection and other basic functions, it acts as an indicator to consider when hunting for malicious activity on the host level. alien labs will continue to monitor the threat and report on any noteworthy activity.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional

            "{'titel': 'malware using new ezuri memory loader', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was written by ofer caspi and fernando martinez of at&t alien labsmultiple threat actors have recently started using a go language (golang) tool to act as a packer and avoid antivirus detection. additionally, the ezuri memory loader tool acts as a malware loader and executes its payload in memory, without writing the file to disk. while this technique is known and commonly used by windows malware, it is less popular in linux environments. the loader decrypts the malicious malware and executes it using memfd create (as described in this blog in 2018). when creating a process, the system returns a file descriptor to an anonymous file in \\'/proc/pid/fd/\\' which is visible only in the filesystem.figure 1 shows a code snippet from the loader, containing the information it uses in order to decrypt the payload using the aes algorithm. figure 1. loader code snippet via alien labs analysis.the loader, written in golang, is taken from the \"ezuri\" code on github via the user guitmz. this user originally created the elf loader around march 2019, when he wrote a blog about the technique to run elf executables from memory and shared the loader on his github. additionally, a similar user ‘tmz’ (presumably associated with the previously mentioned ‘guitmz’) posted this same code in late august, on a small forum where malware samples are shared.the guitmz user even ran tests against virustotal to prove the efficiency of the code, uploading a detected linux.cephei sample (35308b8b770d2d4f78299262f595a0769e55152cb432d0efc42292db01609a18) with 30/61 av detections in virustotal, compared to the zero av detections by the same sample hidden with the ezuri code (ddbb714157f2ef91c1ec350cdf1d1f545290967f61491404c81b4e6e52f5c41f).the execution flow of the loader is to first decrypt the payload and then execute it from memory (figure 2):figure 2. execution flow, retrieved from alien labs analysis.guitmz gave this sample the name ezuri, probably after the card with the same name from the card game “magic: the gathering.” \\xa0this card has the capability to “regenerate another target elf,” reflecting the \\xa0malware’s capability of loading and executing an elf file in memory.at&t alien labs team accessed guitmz’s upload of code for analysis. the tool is written in golang and is intuitive to use. when executing, it first asks the path for the payload to be encrypted, along with the password to be used for aes encryption. if no password is given, the tool generates one, which is used to hide the malware within the loader. after the user\\'s input, the packer compiles the loader with the payload encrypted within it, so it can be decrypted and executed in memory once it is placed in the victim’s system. figure 4 shows the main function of the executable, where the file is first decrypted by “aesdec” to then be run in memory by “runfrommemory”. figure 3 shows ezuri main function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.figure 4 shows the “runfrommemory” function used to execute the payload in memory without placing the detectable malware on disk.figure 4 shows ezuri runfrommemory function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.to use the tool, the user will be requested to enter the file to be hidden, with a target process name as well as an optional aes key for encryption (figure 5):figure 5 shows ezuri execution, retrieved from alien labs analysis.at&t alien labs has identified several malware authors leveraging the ezuri loader in the last few months, including teamtnt, which was the first identified. teamtnt is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least april 2020, when the security firm trend micro first reported on them. the main focus of the group is to target docker systems with misconfigurations, as well as unprotected and exposed management apis, to later install ddos bots and cryptominers in the infected systems. a few months after the trend micro report, in august 2020, cado security found new developments in the teamtnt group. in october 2020, palo alto networks unit42 identified new variants of the cryptomining malware used by teamtnt named “black-t.” this sample first installs three network scanners, and then inspects memory in an attempt to retrieve any type of credentials located in the memory. additionally, unit42 identified several german-language strings in some of the tnt scripts.the last sample identified by palo alto networks unit42 is actually an ezuri loader. the decrypted payload is an elf file packed with upx, which is a known sample from teamtnt, first seen in june 2020 (e15550481e89dbd154b875ce50cc5af4b49f9ff7b837d9ac5b5594e5d63966a3).the techniques and code similarities between the original tool, named ezuri, and the one recently used by teamtnt are vast. the most evident one being the \\'ezuri\\' string in the compiled binary (figure 6):figure 6 shows ezuri string in teamtnt\\xa0sample retrieved from alien labs analysis.using this packer, the antivirus (av) detection drops dramatically. looking at the teamtnt malware detections before using ezuri packer (b494ca3b7bae2ab9a5197b81e928baae5b8eac77dfdc7fe1223fee8f27024772), we see 28/62 av detections of the malware, while the ezuri packed version (751014e0154d219dea8c2e999714c32fd98f817782588cd7af355d2488eb1c80) drops to only 3/64 av detections.in addition to teamtnt, there were several gafgyt samples observed (popular iot device malware with ddos attacks purposes). several malware authors have been using an open source golang tool to act as a malware loader, using a known technique to load the elf binaries into memory and avoid using easy-to-detect files on disk. the authors use the open source tool ezuri, to load its previously seen payloads and avoid antivirus detections on the file. the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe

            "{'titel': 'trickbot bazarloader in depth', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsofer caspi, a fellow alien labs researcher, co-authored this blog.at&t alien labs actively tracks the trickbot group through an automated malware analysis system, hunting, and in-depth technical research. on april 20th, 2020 independent security researchers “pancak3lullz” (@pancak3lullz) and vitali kremez (@vk_intel) posted a tweet regarding two new trickbot modules aptly named “bazarloader” and “bazarbackdoor” after attempted command and control (c2) communications with the emercoin dns (emerdns) .bazar domains. emerdns is desirable for attackers because it is a distributed blockchain that is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. alien labs’ automated malware analysis engine had picked up these samples a few days earlier (ex: 7c93d9175a38c23d44d76d9a883f7f3da1e244c2ab6c3ac9f29a9c9e20d20a5f)bleepingcomputer posted a blog with input from vitali kremez regarding a phishing campaign distributed through the sendgrid email marketing platform delivering covid-19 lures that ultimately led to the trickbot bazarbackdoor. the purpose of this blog is to provide additional technical details and an in-depth study of the signed trickbot bazarloader.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0since trickbot was discovered in 2016 it has been involved in information stealing, credential theft, ransomware, bitcoin mining, and loading other common crimeware malware as a first or second stage loader. for initial access as a first stage loader it typically accomplishes its objective through spear phishing links (t1192) or spear phishing attachments (t1193) using macro enabled microsoft office files. as a second stage payload and dynamic link library (dll) it is frequently loaded by emotet. to a lesser extent trickbot has been loaded by ostap javascript downloader and buer loader. in higher priority, higher profile trickbot anchor campaigns that target enterprises, powertrick and more_eggs/terraloader have been used to load other frameworks.trickbot has recently added a remote desktop protocol (rdp) brute force scanner module, an active directory (ad) harvesting module, and the mexec executor module. there are some indications that trickbot may be moving away from their mshare, mworm, and tabdll modules for retrieving payloads from urls in favor of the “nworm” module performing this task. it is important to note that trickbot group prefers to use shellcode “file-less” modules making detection more difficult.alien labs has previously identified digitally signed trickbot loaders, one of which was signed by an entity named “vb corporate pty. ltd.” pivoting in virustotal on the signer shows the first submission was on 2020-01-02 20:24:57. historically, the trickbot group has continued to reuse their revoked certificates to sign trickbot loaders as long as six months after the initial date of detection on virustotal. a list of known trickbot signers is included below. the associated signature serial numbers are included in the yara rule in the appendix.the trickbot bazarloader authors have produced an advanced module, with a significant amount of obfuscation. the bazarloader/cryptor uses multiple routines to hide api calls and embedded strings, which are then decrypted and resolved at runtime. once executed, the loader will allocate memory to store and decrypt its shellcode, which will be allocated to a numa node for faster execution. after allocation and decryption, the next instructions will jump to the shellcode that will be executed on the heap.next, the malware will try to communicate with .bazar domain c2 servers. once the c2 has been established, the loader will try to inject its payload into a system process using the process hollowing technique (t1093), which will create a suspended thread, unmap the destination image from memory, allocate new memory in the target process, copy the shellcode into the target process, set the thread context, and resume the process. in the sample analyzed, 1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83, the loader will first attempt to inject into an “svchost” process, and if injection fails, it will try to inject into the “explorer.exe” process, and if injection fails again as a last-ditch effort the loader will attempt to inject into the “cmd.exe” process. for persistence the loader will create a registry key under “hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\winlogon\\\\userinit”.the malware uses the windows api “virtualallocexnuma” function to allocate memory for its shellcode to be executed. the “virtualallocexnuma” function is used to allocate memory on a numa node, which allows for faster execution. the implementation can be seen in figure 1 below. it is interesting to note that the “virtualallocexnuma” function is not commonly used in process injection.figure 1. api resolution and shellcode decryption routinesin figure 1 above the bazarloader allocates memory using the uncommon “virtualallocexnuma” routine, and then it uses two iterations of the decryption routine to decrypt its shellcode. in the second call to the decrypt function some of the encryption key bytes are changed based on function parameters. in figure 2 below a representation of the decompiled decrypt routine can be seen importing the encryption key, modifying the encryption key bytes dependent on the parameters passed, and then decrypting the data.figure 2. decryption routinethe bazarloader authors have created dozens of decryption routines, and with almost each string including apis, dlls, and c2s there is a once per use unique decryption routine. an example of multiple decryption routines can be seen in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 below.figure 3. decryption routinefigure 4. decryption routinefigure 5. decryption routinethe loader

            "{'titel': 'a hipaa compliance checklist', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsmaintaining security and compliance with hipaa, the health insurance portability and accountability act, is growing ever more challenging. the networks that house protected health information (phi or ephi) are becoming larger and more complex — especially as organizations move data to the cloud. at the same time, security professionals are faced with an evolving threat landscape of increasingly sophisticated threat actors and methods of attack.for example, 2018 threat intelligence research by at&t alien\\xa0labs reports a rise in the number of targeted ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. these attacks are often backed by organized criminals who see opportunities for making money from health care providers and other similar entities who must protect and keep assets, systems, and networks continuously operating.one such criminal group operating the samsam ransomware is thought to have earned more than $5 million dollars by manually compromising critical healthcare networks. and, according to alienvault labs, the methods used by samsam are more akin to a targeted attack than typical opportunistic ransomware.to help address these security challenges and ensure adherence to compliance mandates, security and it professionals should consider how people, processes, and technology can be used together to create a holistic it security compliance program that simplifies preparation, auditing and reporting, as well as ongoing security risk management and breach monitoring and response. here’s a five-step hipaa compliance checklist to get started.certification and ongoing hipaa compliancehipaa sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. any entity that deals with protected health information must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. in 2009, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act was adopted to promote the “meaningful use of health information technology” and address the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information. although there is no standard or implementation specification that requires a covered entity to “certify” compliance, the evaluation standard § 164.308(a)(8) requires covered entities to perform ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations that establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements. evaluations can be performed and documented internally or by an external organization that provides evaluation or “certification” services. however, hitech requires the hhs office for civil rights (ocr) to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the hipaa privacy, security, and breach notification rules.step 1: start with a comprehensive risk assessment and gap analysisyour compliance strategy should start with a solid foundation, which is why the first step in your journey to hipaa compliance should be a readiness assessment that includes a comprehensive risk and compliance analysis of your electronic health record (ehr) environment. this assessment is often best done by a third party with expertise in healthcare security and compliance, as hipaa regulations can be confusing and cumbersome. using a third party with the necessary expertise will ensure you don’t miss or misunderstand the required regulations, and it will save you time as they will likely have a hipaa checklist to reference.\\xa0your consultant can perform an initial evaluation of your entire security program to determine its adherence to hipaa regulations and the level of readiness to proceed with the “certification” process. it’s worth noting that the ocr does not actually “certify” hipaa compliance (see side bar), however there are organizations outside of the ocr that do provide “certification” services, and many organizations take advantage of these certification services to prove compliance. as a result of the evaluation, your consultant should provide a comprehensive report that may include such things as:according to the ocr, organizations that have aligned their security programs to the national institute for standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework may find it helpful as a starting place to identify potential gaps in their compliance with the hipaa security rule. addressing these gaps can bolster compliance with the security rule and improve the organization’s ability to secure ephi and other critical information and business processes. read how nist “maps” to the hipaa security rule in the hipaa security rule crosswalk to nist cybersecurity framework.step 2: remediate identified risks and address compliance gapsonce you’ve identified your organization’s risks, take immediate steps to address the gaps within your security program. again, a consultant who has practical experience in healthcare security will be very useful in providing strategic guidance, as well as advice on risk mitigation. many organizations use the same consultant who performed their initial risk assessment.your consultant may develop specific programs, policies, standards, and procedures, as well as support or help implement key security practices and controls. for example, they may assist in prioritizing vulnerabilities and make recommendations for remediation in your ehr environment. or, they may provide pre-packaged employee security awareness training that meets hipaa guidelines, such as educating employees on security risks and running them through attack scenarios.make use of security technology to help you more quickly address the gaps in your compliance program — and consider platforms versus point solutions, giving you the ability to address multiple issues at once. also, look for solutions that address both on-premises and multi-cloud environments as hipaa regulations apply to both (see guidance on hipaa & cloud computing).\\xa0for example, look for such use cases as the automation of asset discovery and the ability to categorize those assets into hipaa groups for easy management and reporting. those same solutions may also perform vulnerability assessments, automate the prioritization of vulnerabilities for mitigation, and integrate with ticketing solutions to ensure the most critical are being remediated while overall risks are mitigated.step 3: take advantage of automated compliance reportingthe evaluation standard of hipaa requires covered entities to perform and document ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations to establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements.most solutions do not cover all the requirements defined by the hipaa audit protocol, but they will give you a jump on your hipaa checklist.many security management platforms also include additional predefined event reports, such as reports by data source and data source type, helping to make daily compliance monitoring and reporting activities more efficient.also, look for an intuitive and flexible interface that allows you to quickly search and analyze your security data, as well as the ability to create and save custom views and export them as executive-ready reports.finally, solutions that provide centralized visibility of your cloud and on-premises assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and log data from firewalls and other security tools are key to giving you the most complete and contextual data set for maintaining and documenting continuous compliance.step 4: implement monitoring and breach notification protocolsthe breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and business associates to provide notifications if they experience a breach that involves unsecured protected health information.security management platforms can help to simplify and automate monitoring for breaches on your network, ensuring you are able to more quickly detect and contain a breach, as well as provide the required notifications.as more organizations in healthcare are migrating data and applications to the cloud, make sure the technology you’re choosing offers advanced threat detection across both on-premises and multi-cloud environments. simplify compliance management by choosing a solution that combines an array of essential security capabilities in one platform. these may include, but are not limited to: asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, endpoint detection and response, siem event correlation, file integrity monitoring (fim), and log management. by combining these use cases in a single dashboard, you are better able to quickly identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats that target your ehr environment.intelligence it key to threat detection and incident response, so consider vendors who have in-house research teams as well as access to external threat intelligence communities and other sources that can provide insight into the latest global threats and vulnerabilities — and in particular, those that are specific to healthcare.however, intelligence without context will create lot of distracting “noise” for your team. so, check that the solution goes beyond just providing intelligence to incorporating it directly into your dashboard, including providing recommendations on how to respond to identified threats. with this intelligence and guidance at your fingertips, you can react quickly to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. and, you are assured of an always-up-to-date and optimally performing security monitoring solution.need more info on how to respond to a breach? see the hhs quick response checklist.step 5: continuously evaluate and manage riskwhether you are managing ongoing hipaa compliance internally or are using an external organization, avoid last-minute scrambling for annual evaluations and audits by employing a year-round risk management program. such a program requires having real-time visibility of your environment, including system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall information, and product upgrades.use a unified platform to gain this visibility and enable monitoring in a central location (opposed to various point solutions). here are a few examples of where a platform would be helpful for continuous risk and compliance management:examples: use automated asset discovery for on-premises and cloud environments and then create asset groups such as business critical assets or hipaa assets for ongoing monitoring, management and reporting. identify systems with known vulnerabilities and use correlation rules to detect threats.examples: monitor for successful and failed logon events to assets. monitor for communications with known malicious ip addresses or use file integrity monitoring (fim) to detect, assess and report on changes to system binaries, and content locations. schedule vulnerability scans, automate assessments, and plan for mitigation. review events and detected incidents.examples: aggregate events from across on-premises and multi-cloud environments. classify threats based on their risk level. monitor for stolen credentials, malware-based compromises such as communication to a known command and control (c&c) server, anomalous user and admin activities, file integrity, and vulnerabilities.example: automate forensics tasks to be executed in response to a detected threat and simplify forensics investigations with filters, search and reporting capabilities for event and log data. automate actions to contain threats, such as isolating systems from the network.use out-of-the box reporting to document that you’ve made an accurate assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic phi — and to quickly show the status of technical controls that align to hipaa or other regulations.maintaining adherence to hipaa is no small feat considering the dozens of criteria that are considered in the hipaa audit checklist. attempting to manage your compliance program manually and without the help of expert healthcare security consultants will not only take up massive amounts of time, it could result in your team missing an essential component of the regulation, or worse yet, enduring a breach that compromises patient data or takes down the network. however, with the right mix of people, processes and technology, it’s not an impossible to stay on top of compliance management while ensuring your network is secure and patient data protected year-round.hipaa regulationshipaa privacy rule: this rule set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by three types of covered entities: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and health care providers who conduct the standard healthcare transactions electronically.\\xa0hipaa security rule: this rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. the privacy rule is located at 45 cfr part 160 and subparts a and e of part 164\\xa0(e-phi).hipaa breach and notification rule: the hipaa breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information.tags: ransomware, risk management,

            "{'titel': 'slack phishing attacks using webhooks', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsslack is a cloud-based messaging platform that is commonly used in workplace communications. it is feature-rich, offering additional functionality such as video calling and screen sharing in addition to a marketplace containing thousands of third-party applications and add-ons.slack incoming webhooks allow you to post messages from your applications to slack. by specifying a unique url, your message body, and a destination channel, you can send a message to any webhook that you know the url for in any workspace, regardless of membership. webhooks take the format of https://hooks.slack.com/services/t00000000/b00000000/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.generally, slack webhooks are considered a low risk integration due to the following assumptions:a deeper dive into webhooks shows that this is not entirely accurate.first, a channel override allows you to override the previously specified webhook target channel by adding the “channel” key to your json payload. if you gain access to a webhook for one channel, you can use it in others. considering sending to #general, #engineering, and other default or common channels to target a wider audience.in some cases, this can also override channel posting permissions (such as admin-only posting).slack documentation suggests that allowed target channels are based on the original creator of the webhook: “posting_to_general_channel_denied is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the \"#general\" channel for a workspace where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. you\\'ll receive this error with a http 403.” so if you can find a webhook created by an admin - congrats, you can post to admin channels!a quick search on github shows 130,989 public code results containing slack webhook urls, with a majority containing the full unique webhook value.the last assumption is true - webhooks can only accept data. that’s where we get creative.the process itself is fairly simple:as mentioned earlier, github is a good start for scraping publicly committed webhook data.first, create an app. you will also need a web server to handle the oauth flow.slack apps don’t require oauth, but in this case we will be using the slack api to access data in workspaces where the malicious app is installed. when the user attempts to install the application, they must approve the requested oauth scopes. their approval is sent to the oauth client, which retrieves an access token from the authorization server. this access token may be used to retrieve data using the specified service scopes until authorization is revoked. read more about using oauth 2.0 here.you will also need to set your oauth scope(s) to whatever data you want to exfiltrate from slack. in my case, i chose files:read in order to access files on the victim\\'s workspace.your redirect url must be set to the oauth client url.the following code snippet can be used to handle the oauth 2.0 handshake using python and flask.the following payload will send a message to the #general channel associated with the unique webhook url. in this scenario, we’re claiming that the webhook configuration needs to be updated.payload:message:the link points to https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?scope=files:read&client_id=834500968371.846020497941, which is actually the shareable url for my malicious slack app.upon clicking, the user will be directed to install “webhook configuration”.at no point is it clear that the victim has interacted with any domain except for slack.com.after exchanging the temporary authorization code for the access token, you will receive a response from slack containing the access token in addition to some other data, including identifiers for the user, team, and enterprise they are part of.distribution statistics can also be tracked from your app’s distribution page at https://api.slack.com/apps/.once you receive the user’s access token, you are free to access data on their behalf. note that slack has mostly moved to using perspectival scopes, i.e. user tokens or bot tokens that give access within the context of that entity. what you can access depends on the requester access and the scopes that your app initially requested. in my example, files:read was used.the above request allows us to list all files that the user has access to, and subsequently download each of them using the access token and the private url returned by the files.list method.the example in this post shows a simple phishing and data exfiltration flow. in theory, this could also be used for propagation of attacks across users and workspaces.the chat.postmessage method allows you to send messages via channel or direct message. with the chat:write:user permission, messages can be sent as_user using the context of the user token. compromising one member of your workspace would allow more targeted or convincing malicious messages to be sent to channels they are part of or directly to their peers, similar to the high-profile gsuite phishing attack in 2018 which was also covered by us in a previous blog post.users of shared channels can direct message users participating in the shared channels across workspaces. targeting those users would allow for compromise across multiple workspaces.application whitelistingadministrators have the option to manage their users’ slack applications. in less sensitive workspaces, this may involve only allowing apps from the app directory. applications added to the directory are required to go through slack’s own app security review process prior to approval.more sensitive environments may call for application whitelisting/application approval, requiring an administrator to review and approve applications before installation. this option is strongly recommended for companies looking to comply with ccpa, gdpr, and other regulations that require tracking of sharing of personal data with third parties.detection of suspicious oauth applicationsif whitelisting is not an option or you’d like an extra layer of defense, you may be interested in detecting suspicious slack oauth applications that users are adding to your workspace. by ingesting slack audit log data into a security analytics platform such as usm anywhere, one can alert on these suspicious actions.for example, some items of interest might include:see more on the event actions that can be monitored in slack’s official documentation.some mitigations could only be implemented by slack.implement least privilege for incoming webhookswebhooks should default to only working in the defined channel. multi-channel webhooks/overrides should be a separate application or opt-in setting. since the override feature is nested under a “setup instructions” pane that requires user interaction to display, many users are not aware of it. webhooks should not be able to post to announcement-only/admin-only channels unless that channel is explicitly defined in the webhook configuration.improved awareness of secrets handlingnone of the text on the incoming webhook configuration page asserts the importance of secure storage of the webhook url. this issue paired with the hidden “features” of incoming webhooks may lead to users assuming low-to-no risk associated with webhooks, as is supported by the frequency of webhooks publicly committed.application verificationapps that have not been reviewed by slack and are not local to the workspace should have limited functionality or require further verification. consider a process similar to the google oauth verification process, where unverified apps using high-risk scopes require additional developer identity verification and/or are capped to a certain number of users to avoid widespread abuse.webhooks are credential tools that provide access to posting functionality within a workspace.\\xa0though data cannot be exposed through webhooks on slack, we do recommend that workspace owners or admins invalidate publicly exposed webhook urls and generate new ones. to help slack admins with that diligence, we\\xa0proactively scrape github for publicly exposed webhooks and invalidate them. webhooks are safe as long as they remain secret since the webhook url itself is unguessable.\\xa0we also recommend workspace owners and admins use\\xa0these best practices\\xa0for storing credentials safely and that they review\\xa0this guide\\xa0to sending messages using incoming webhooks.we also provide additional features to support the proper oversight of app installation and usage within workspaces, which help workspace owners and admins protect their workspaces. we allow teams to require admin approvals on all apps, and recommend they establish and follow basic security diligence procedures before permitting apps to be added into a workspace. our security recommendations for approving apps can be found\\xa0here.tags: phishing, slack, webhooksinsights reportat&t cybersecurity

            "{'titel': 'securing aws policies', 'Explanation': \"powered byat&t alien labsaws policies are a key foundation in good cloud security, but they are often overlooked. in this blog, we take a quick look on some aws policies, particularly for\\xa0identity and access management\\xa0(iam), that could become problematic if not properly managed. we'll discuss how they can be used against us to generate attacks like: ransomware, data exfiltration, credential abuse, and more. finally, we'll suggest some open source tools for cloud policy assessment and pentesting.\\xa0\\xa0the first step in achieving good security is having effective policies to regulate what can and cannot be done in an environment, both physical devices and cloud infrastructure. these regulatory policies are frequently hard to define and keep up-to-date, especially in a fast-paced environment using infrastructure-as-a-service (iaas). this blog looks at some changes in policies\\xa0which can reduce success in some common attack types involving: exfiltration, ransomware, credential abuse, and more. for that reason, at&t alien labs is sharing an easy ‘what to look for’ list in order to detect some red flags in aws policy changes. it is our hope that this\\xa0list will be helpful\\xa0for security analysts and forensic investigators.policies are spoiler alert, defined by aws policies, which define permissions for identities and resources. every time\\xa0aws identity and access management makes a request of any kind to a resource, a policy determines if the iam is allowed or denied access to that specific resource under the policies for the involved parties.a full understanding of aws policies (types, creation, enforcement, etc.) is outside the scope of this\\xa0blog, but it can be found in aws documentation.people implementing aws policies should have knowledge of the organization, adapting\\xa0policies to needs of the business. afterwards, detection rules should be generated\\xa0for red flags in cloudtrail or other security tools. by doing this, we are avoiding policy changes in a generic manner, for example using ‘*’ to cover the whole principal without setting any conditions to it (mfa, ip, usernames, etc.). the problem resides in changes occurring on a daily basis to the policies, which are often overlooked by analysts. the impact that these changes could have\\xa0is as big as any other event or alert investigated.in order to classify all aws actions involving a policy change that could be used by attackers, we’ll sort them based on the potential final attack type. most of the following techniques would fall under modify cloud compute infrastructure (t1578) but we have attempted to classify them outside of their specific cloud technique - as if the activity was happening in a traditional environment.endpoint denial of service (t1499): adversaries may perform endpoint dos attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. this blockage could be used as an additional impact on top of data encrypted for impact (t1486) to avoid or slow down\\xa0recovery efforts in a ransomware attack. in this scenario, attackers could be trying to block access to several aws resources like: s3, ec2 through efs or ebs, or backups between others.s3: amazon’s storage service can suffer a dos by adding policies that block access to its contents. buckets and access points are both s3 resources that could be impacted by an excessively restrictive policy or access control list (acl), hence their relevance.detection guidance:event/command:putaccesspointpolicy or putbucketpolicy or putbucketacl or putobjectacleffect:denyaction:s3:* or s3-outposts:*guardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)additionally, the events deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicy would have a similar effect, since they would be removing the policies where the public access is allowed.detection guidance:event/command:deleteaccesspointpolicy or deletebucketpolicyguardduty alert:policy:s3/accountblockpublicaccessdisabled or policy:s3/bucketblockpublicaccessdisabled (previously known as policy:iamuser/s3blockpublicaccessdisabled)in a similar situation, amazon’s elastic file system (efs): any policy change denying access to this storage solution\\xa0could also lead to a dos. due to this, these\\xa0events and resource policies should be closely observed.detection guidance:event/commandputfilesystempolicyeffectdenyactionelasticfilesystem:clientmount or elasticfilesystem:clientwriteguardduty alert-indicator removal on host (t1070): adversaries may delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system, including logs or captured files, such as quarantined malware. in this case, removed indicators not only affect the host, but the whole cloud and the log ingestion platform in charge of generating alerts. the main affected resource is cloudwatch, but there are others too.cloudwatch is\\xa0the monitoring service for aws resources\\xa0tracks logs coming from different resources and accounts in aws. blocking the logging access to resources would have a similar effect as deleting logs in a traditional computer.putresourcepolicy gives permission for other aws services to put log events to the current account. a new policy with effect deny on all\\xa0could avoid resources logging on their expected log file, and delay alerting on a detection. additionally, putdestinationpolicy has a similar\\xa0behavior -

            "{'titel': 'the rise of qakbot', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was jointly written with ofer caspi. some of the links in this blog require an otx account, and the qakbot infrastructure tracker will require readers to be customers with access to the threat intel subscription.. thanks to the following researchers and the malwarebazaar project:at&t alien labs closely monitors the evolution of crimeware such as the qakbot\\xa0(also known as qbot) malware family and campaigns in connection with qakbot. the jointly coordinated takedown of the actors behind emotet in late january has left a gap in the cybercrime landscape, which qakbot seems poised to fill.key points:qakbot, also known as qbot or pinkslipbot, is a modular information stealer. it has been active since 2007 and primarily used by financially motivated actors. it was initially known as a banking trojan and a loader using c2 servers for payload delivery; however, its use expanded beyond strictly being a banking trojan. the hallmarks of a qakbot infection chain consist of a phishing lure (t1566) delivered via email chain hijacking or spoofed emails that contain context-aware information such as shipping, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, claims, etc. the phishing emails alternate between file attachments (t1566.001) and links (t1566.002). qakbot is often used as a gateway entry, similar to trickbot or emotet, that leads to post exploitation operations leveraging frameworks such as cobalt strike as well as delivering ransomware.qakbot email lures are not the most sophisticated; however, by using contextually aware themes that originate from hijacked email chains or potentially compromised accounts within a user’s social circle, they are effective. figure 1 below illustrates an example of a recent qakbot lure with the subject “re: signed quote” and a zip file attachment labeled “cancellation_letter_272020508-02242021.zip”.figure 1. qakbot \"signed quote\" email lurethe actors further establish the trust and confidence of the targeted user by presenting a semi-official looking docusign graphic that guides the user through the process of enabling the excel 4 macros. a representative sample, 78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a, seen in a recent qakbot campaign is shown in figure 2 below.figure 2. qakbot docusign lureqakbot excel spreadsheets often contain hidden spreadsheets, excel 4.0 macros, spreadsheet formulas, and biff records all designed to pass a visual inspection from the user with the added benefit of bypassing detection mechanisms that attempt to parse multiple legacy formats inside the spreadsheet. figure 3 below shows a screenshot of output from the open-source xlmmacrodeobfuscator tool, which decodes obfuscated excel 4.0 macros.figure 3. xlmmacrodeobfuscator output for a qakbot excel 4.0 macro spreadsheetonce the excel 4.0 macro is decoded it is possible to see the call to urldownloadtofilea, which downloads the qakbot dll in this campaign from http[:]//rlyrt26rnxw02vqijgs[.]com/fera/frid[.]gif. next, the exec function is evaluated which executes “rundll32.exe nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver”. it is also a common tactic for qakbot to execute “regsvr32.exe -s nxckew.wle,dllregisterserver”. both instances are designed to evade sandbox environments that do not supply the expected command line arguments. a representative qakbot dll analyzed by alien labs, 9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28, has two exports: the entry point (0x10005a5d) and dllregisterserver (0x10029c88)and if dllregisterserver is not called via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe with command line options, then only the entry point is called and the malicious code in dllregisterserver is not called. figure 3 below shows improved readability and de-obfuscation of the macro by manually replacing and substituting the cell values and formulas.figure 3. better de-obfuscation of the spreadsheetthe results of our additional de-obfuscation efforts are confirmed when the qakbot excel spreadsheet is run inside a sandbox in figure 4 below.figure 4. otx screenshot showing the “rundll32 ..\\\\nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver\\'\\' executionbefore executing the main payload, the qakbot loader will first test the infected system to see if it is a good candidate for infection. the qakbot loader is responsible for checking its environment to include whether it is running on a virtual machine, identifying any installed and running security and monitoring tools such as antivirus products or common security researcher tools. figure 5 below shows a high-level execution flow of the qakbot loader.figure 5. qakbot execution flowto make detection and analysis harder, qakbot encrypts its strings and decrypts them at runtime before use. once the qakbot execution logic is finished using a string, it will immediately delete the string from memory. an example of this can be seen in figure 6 below, which shows qakbot decrypting a string containing the value for lpprocname passed as a parameter to the getprocaddress api call. the selected function, which has been labeled in ida pro as, “oc_clear_mem” deletes the string memory right after it retrieves the process address.figure 6. qakbot getprocaddress and clear_mem routineswhen executed, qakbot will check whether it has previously been executed on the machine by checking for the specified malware folder. if qakbot discovers it is a first time run, it will relaunch itself from cmd.exe with the /c parameter that will inform the loader to proceed and run its anti-vm checks on the machine and return the results to the parent process. if qakbot detects it is running in a vm environment, then the final payload will not be decrypted since qakbot uses the return value from these checks in its final decryption routine. figure 7 below shows the qakbot environment check logic.figure 7. qakbot environment check logicspecifically, qakbot checks the system for the names of running processes that match the strings listed in table 1 below.process namesfigure 8 below shows the decryption routine for the security and monitoring tool strings (t1140).figure 8. qakbot decrypting tool check stringsqakbot will also add its folder to the windows defender exclusions setting located in the registry (t1112), which prevents defender from scanning qakbot artifacts. the registry location can be seen in figure 9 below.figure 9. qakbot adding exclusion paths to windows defender settingsin addition to the previously mentioned environment check, qakbot collects system information (t1082) such as computer name, system directories, user profiles, and more, which is shown in figure 10 below.figure 10. qakbot system information collectionqakbot will use process hollowing (t1055.012) in order to inject itself into explorer.exe. if it is unsuccessful then qakbot will attempt to inject itself into mobsync.exe or iexplore.exe. the screen shot in figure 11 illustrates the qakbot process name decryption routine.\\xa0figure 11. qakbot routine to decrypt process names for injectionfigure 12 below shows the qakbot logic to overwrite the suspended explorer.exe process and then resume its execution.figure 12. qakbot process hollowing routineadditionally, qakbot abuses the service control manager (scm) to create a child process, which is then detached from the parent when the scm terminates the parent process. qakbot c2 communications begin in this stage to make it more difficult to monitor. figure 13 below shows the scm spawned process abuse technique.figure 13. qakbot abusing scm to spawn a detached processfigure 14 below shows the qakbot c2 ping during the scm interaction.figure 14. qakbot sending c2 pingfinally, if the qakbot loader has verified its execution environment has passed its tests, then qakbot will proceed to decrypt and execute the main qakbot payload, which is hidden as resource “307”. the decryption and import table resolution of its main payload is shown in figure 15 below.figure 15. qakbot decryption and import table resolution of main payloadthe combined anti-analysis and evasion techniques across the infection chain significantly impair antivirus, edr, and other security defenses from detecting and preventing the initial infection. despite the limitations and challenges presented by qakbot dlls there is ample opportunity to detect qakbot loaders signed by revoked and blacklisted malicious certificates. alien labs has identified 42 unique signers and signature serial numbers, which are included in detection methods section to aid in detection and hunting with yara and osquery. additionally, there are a number of behavioral patterns, indicators of behavior (iob), which provide opportunities for detection.alien labs has observed qakbot over the past three months being used in a role similar to trickbot, which includes malspam delivery, stealthy maldocs dropping signed loaders, establishing a foothold, and finally post exploitation activities such as lateral movement, access operations, and ransomware delivery. alien labs actively tracks the qakbot c2 infrastructure for customers, which is available via otx here.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by

cryptomining malware using a new memory loader based on ezuri and written in golang. since then, teamtnt has added another tool to their list of capabilities.the objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.the tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on github, described as \"hide a process under linux using the ld preloader.\\'\\' preloading allows the system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. if the custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the system libraries, the custom version will override it.the tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.the new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the teamtnt cryptominer binary or ircbot (figure 1):figure 1. base64 encoded script, via alien labs analysis.upon binary execution, the bash script will run through a multitude of tasks. specifically, the script will:after decoding, we can observe the bash script functionality and how some malicious activity occurs before the shared library is created (figure 2):figure 2. decoded bash script, via alien labs analysis.the new tool is first dropped as a hidden tar file on disk, the script decompresses it, writes it to \\'/usr/local/lib/systemhealt.so\\', and then adds it preload via \\'/etc/ld.so.preload\\'. this will be used by the system to preload the file before other system libraries, allowing the attacker to override some common functions (figure 3/4).figure 3/4. bash script features, via alien labs analysis.the main purpose of the tool is to hide the teamtnt bot from process viewer tools, which use the

            "{'titel': 'malware using new ezuri memory loader', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was written by ofer caspi and fernando martinez of at&t alien labsmultiple threat actors have recently started using a go language (golang) tool to act as a packer and avoid antivirus detection. additionally, the ezuri memory loader tool acts as a malware loader and executes its payload in memory, without writing the file to disk. while this technique is known and commonly used by windows malware, it is less popular in linux environments. the loader decrypts the malicious malware and executes it using memfd create (as described in this blog in 2018). when creating a process, the system returns a file descriptor to an anonymous file in \\'/proc/pid/fd/\\' which is visible only in the filesystem.figure 1 shows a code snippet from the loader, containing the information it uses in order to decrypt the payload using the aes algorithm. figure 1. loader code snippet via alien labs analysis.the loader, written in golang, is taken from the \"ezuri\" code on github via the user guitmz. this user originally created the elf loader around march 2019, when he wrote a blog about the technique to run elf executables from memory and shared the loader on his github. additionally, a similar user ‘tmz’ (presumably associated with the previously mentioned ‘guitmz’) posted this same code in late august, on a small forum where malware samples are shared.the guitmz user even ran tests against virustotal to prove the efficiency of the code, uploading a detected linux.cephei sample (35308b8b770d2d4f78299262f595a0769e55152cb432d0efc42292db01609a18) with 30/61 av detections in virustotal, compared to the zero av detections by the same sample hidden with the ezuri code (ddbb714157f2ef91c1ec350cdf1d1f545290967f61491404c81b4e6e52f5c41f).the execution flow of the loader is to first decrypt the payload and then execute it from memory (figure 2):figure 2. execution flow, retrieved from alien labs analysis.guitmz gave this sample the name ezuri, probably after the card with the same name from the card game “magic: the gathering.” \\xa0this card has the capability to “regenerate another target elf,” reflecting the \\xa0malware’s capability of loading and executing an elf file in memory.at&t alien labs team accessed guitmz’s upload of code for analysis. the tool is written in golang and is intuitive to use. when executing, it first asks the path for the payload to be encrypted, along with the password to be used for aes encryption. if no password is given, the tool generates one, which is used to hide the malware within the loader. after the user\\'s input, the packer compiles the loader with the payload encrypted within it, so it can be decrypted and executed in memory once it is placed in the victim’s system. figure 4 shows the main function of the executable, where the file is first decrypted by “aesdec” to then be run in memory by “runfrommemory”. figure 3 shows ezuri main function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.figure 4 shows the “runfrommemory” function used to execute the payload in memory without placing the detectable malware on disk.figure 4 shows ezuri runfrommemory function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.to use the tool, the user will be requested to enter the file to be hidden, with a target process name as well as an optional aes key for encryption (figure 5):figure 5 shows ezuri execution, retrieved from alien labs analysis.at&t alien labs has identified several malware authors leveraging the ezuri loader in the last few months, including teamtnt, which was the first identified. teamtnt is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least april 2020, when the security firm trend micro first reported on them. the main focus of the group is to target docker systems with misconfigurations, as well as unprotected and exposed management apis, to later install ddos bots and cryptominers in the infected systems. a few months after the trend micro report, in august 2020, cado security found new developments in the teamtnt group. in october 2020, palo alto networks unit42 identified new variants of the cryptomining malware used by teamtnt named “black-t.” this sample first installs three network scanners, and then inspects memory in an attempt to retrieve any type of credentials located in the memory. additionally, unit42 identified several german-language strings in some of the tnt scripts.the last sample identified by palo alto networks unit42 is actually an ezuri loader. the decrypted payload is an elf file packed with upx, which is a known sample from teamtnt, first seen in june 2020 (e15550481e89dbd154b875ce50cc5af4b49f9ff7b837d9ac5b5594e5d63966a3).the techniques and code similarities between the original tool, named ezuri, and the one recently used by teamtnt are vast. the most evident one being the \\'ezuri\\' string in the compiled binary (figure 6):figure 6 shows ezuri string in teamtnt\\xa0sample retrieved from alien labs analysis.using this packer, the antivirus (av) detection drops dramatically. looking at the teamtnt malware detections before using ezuri packer (b494ca3b7bae2ab9a5197b81e928baae5b8eac77dfdc7fe1223fee8f27024772), we see 28/62 av detections of the malware, while the ezuri packed version (751014e0154d219dea8c2e999714c32fd98f817782588cd7af355d2488eb1c80) drops to only 3/64 av detections.in addition to teamtnt, there were several gafgyt samples observed (popular iot device malware with ddos attacks purposes). several malware authors have been using an open source golang tool to act as a malware loader, using a known technique to load the elf binaries into memory and avoid using easy-to-detect files on disk. the authors use the open source tool ezuri, to load its previously seen payloads and avoid antivirus detections on the file. the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe

            "{'titel': 'trickbot bazarloader in depth', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsofer caspi, a fellow alien labs researcher, co-authored this blog.at&t alien labs actively tracks the trickbot group through an automated malware analysis system, hunting, and in-depth technical research. on april 20th, 2020 independent security researchers “pancak3lullz” (@pancak3lullz) and vitali kremez (@vk_intel) posted a tweet regarding two new trickbot modules aptly named “bazarloader” and “bazarbackdoor” after attempted command and control (c2) communications with the emercoin dns (emerdns) .bazar domains. emerdns is desirable for attackers because it is a distributed blockchain that is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. alien labs’ automated malware analysis engine had picked up these samples a few days earlier (ex: 7c93d9175a38c23d44d76d9a883f7f3da1e244c2ab6c3ac9f29a9c9e20d20a5f)bleepingcomputer posted a blog with input from vitali kremez regarding a phishing campaign distributed through the sendgrid email marketing platform delivering covid-19 lures that ultimately led to the trickbot bazarbackdoor. the purpose of this blog is to provide additional technical details and an in-depth study of the signed trickbot bazarloader.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0since trickbot was discovered in 2016 it has been involved in information stealing, credential theft, ransomware, bitcoin mining, and loading other common crimeware malware as a first or second stage loader. for initial access as a first stage loader it typically accomplishes its objective through spear phishing links (t1192) or spear phishing attachments (t1193) using macro enabled microsoft office files. as a second stage payload and dynamic link library (dll) it is frequently loaded by emotet. to a lesser extent trickbot has been loaded by ostap javascript downloader and buer loader. in higher priority, higher profile trickbot anchor campaigns that target enterprises, powertrick and more_eggs/terraloader have been used to load other frameworks.trickbot has recently added a remote desktop protocol (rdp) brute force scanner module, an active directory (ad) harvesting module, and the mexec executor module. there are some indications that trickbot may be moving away from their mshare, mworm, and tabdll modules for retrieving payloads from urls in favor of the “nworm” module performing this task. it is important to note that trickbot group prefers to use shellcode “file-less” modules making detection more difficult.alien labs has previously identified digitally signed trickbot loaders, one of which was signed by an entity named “vb corporate pty. ltd.” pivoting in virustotal on the signer shows the first submission was on 2020-01-02 20:24:57. historically, the trickbot group has continued to reuse their revoked certificates to sign trickbot loaders as long as six months after the initial date of detection on virustotal. a list of known trickbot signers is included below. the associated signature serial numbers are included in the yara rule in the appendix.the trickbot bazarloader authors have produced an advanced module, with a significant amount of obfuscation. the bazarloader/cryptor uses multiple routines to hide api calls and embedded strings, which are then decrypted and resolved at runtime. once executed, the loader will allocate memory to store and decrypt its shellcode, which will be allocated to a numa node for faster execution. after allocation and decryption, the next instructions will jump to the shellcode that will be executed on the heap.next, the malware will try to communicate with .bazar domain c2 servers. once the c2 has been established, the loader will try to inject its payload into a system process using the process hollowing technique (t1093), which will create a suspended thread, unmap the destination image from memory, allocate new memory in the target process, copy the shellcode into the target process, set the thread context, and resume the process. in the sample analyzed, 1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83, the loader will first attempt to inject into an “svchost” process, and if injection fails, it will try to inject into the “explorer.exe” process, and if injection fails again as a last-ditch effort the loader will attempt to inject into the “cmd.exe” process. for persistence the loader will create a registry key under “hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\winlogon\\\\userinit”.the malware uses the windows api “virtualallocexnuma” function to allocate memory for its shellcode to be executed. the “virtualallocexnuma” function is used to allocate memory on a numa node, which allows for faster execution. the implementation can be seen in figure 1 below. it is interesting to note that the “virtualallocexnuma” function is not commonly used in process injection.figure 1. api resolution and shellcode decryption routinesin figure 1 above the bazarloader allocates memory using the uncommon “virtualallocexnuma” routine, and then it uses two iterations of the decryption routine to decrypt its shellcode. in the second call to the decrypt function some of the encryption key bytes are changed based on function parameters. in figure 2 below a representation of the decompiled decrypt routine can be seen importing the encryption key, modifying the encryption key bytes dependent on the parameters passed, and then decrypting the data.figure 2. decryption routinethe bazarloader authors have created dozens of decryption routines, and with almost each string including apis, dlls, and c2s there is a once per use unique decryption routine. an example of multiple decryption routines can be seen in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 below.figure 3. decryption routinefigure 4. decryption routinefigure 5. decryption routinethe loader uses the same decryption technique described above to resolve the api calls it uses during execution. the windows api resolution can be seen in figure 6 below.figure 6. windows api resolutionfor injection, the malware resolves apis from the ntdll.dll after it loads from disk and checks that there are no inline hooks within its function, that could be created for example by av software that tracks those api calls.the targeted processes for injection can be seen in figure 7 below.figure 7. targeted svchost, explorer, and cmd windows processes\\xa0the bazarloader injection code can be seen

            "{'titel': 'a hipaa compliance checklist', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsmaintaining security and compliance with hipaa, the health insurance portability and accountability act, is growing ever more challenging. the networks that house protected health information (phi or ephi) are becoming larger and more complex — especially as organizations move data to the cloud. at the same time, security professionals are faced with an evolving threat landscape of increasingly sophisticated threat actors and methods of attack.for example, 2018 threat intelligence research by at&t alien\\xa0labs reports a rise in the number of targeted ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. these attacks are often backed by organized criminals who see opportunities for making money from health care providers and other similar entities who must protect and keep assets, systems, and networks continuously operating.one such criminal group operating the samsam ransomware is thought to have earned more than $5 million dollars by manually compromising critical healthcare networks. and, according to alienvault labs, the methods used by samsam are more akin to a targeted attack than typical opportunistic ransomware.to help address these security challenges and ensure adherence to compliance mandates, security and it professionals should consider how people, processes, and technology can be used together to create a holistic it security compliance program that simplifies preparation, auditing and reporting, as well as ongoing security risk management and breach monitoring and response. here’s a five-step hipaa compliance checklist to get started.certification and ongoing hipaa compliancehipaa sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. any entity that deals with protected health information must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. in 2009, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act was adopted to promote the “meaningful use of health information technology” and address the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information. although there is no standard or implementation specification that requires a covered entity to “certify” compliance, the evaluation standard § 164.308(a)(8) requires covered entities to perform ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations that establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements. evaluations can be performed and documented internally or by an external organization that provides evaluation or “certification” services. however, hitech requires the hhs office for civil rights (ocr) to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the hipaa privacy, security, and breach notification rules.step 1: start with a comprehensive risk assessment and gap analysisyour compliance strategy should start with a solid foundation, which is why the first step in your journey to hipaa compliance should be a readiness assessment that includes a comprehensive risk and compliance analysis of your electronic health record (ehr) environment. this assessment is often best done by a third party with expertise in healthcare security and compliance, as hipaa regulations can be confusing and cumbersome. using a third party with the necessary expertise will ensure you don’t miss or misunderstand the required regulations, and it will save you time as they will likely have a hipaa checklist to reference.\\xa0your consultant can perform an initial evaluation of your entire security program to determine its adherence to hipaa regulations and the level of readiness to proceed with the “certification” process. it’s worth noting that the ocr does not actually “certify” hipaa compliance (see side bar), however there are organizations outside of the ocr that do provide “certification” services, and many organizations take advantage of these certification services to prove compliance. as a result of the evaluation, your consultant should provide a comprehensive report that may include such things as:according to the ocr, organizations that have aligned their security programs to the national institute for standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework may find it helpful as a starting place to identify potential gaps in their compliance with the hipaa security rule. addressing these gaps can bolster compliance with the security rule and improve the organization’s ability to secure ephi and other critical information and business processes. read how nist “maps” to the hipaa security rule in the hipaa security rule crosswalk to nist cybersecurity framework.step 2: remediate identified risks and address compliance gapsonce you’ve identified your organization’s risks, take immediate steps to address the gaps within your security program. again, a consultant who has practical experience in healthcare security will be very useful in providing strategic guidance, as well as advice on risk mitigation. many organizations use the same consultant who performed their initial risk assessment.your consultant may develop specific programs, policies, standards, and procedures, as well as support or help implement key security practices and controls. for example, they may assist in prioritizing vulnerabilities and make recommendations for remediation in your ehr environment. or, they may provide pre-packaged employee security awareness training that meets hipaa guidelines, such as educating employees on security risks and running them through attack scenarios.make use of security technology to help you more quickly address the gaps in your compliance program — and consider platforms versus point solutions, giving you the ability to address multiple issues at once. also, look for solutions that address both on-premises and multi-cloud environments as hipaa regulations apply to both (see guidance on hipaa & cloud computing).\\xa0for example, look for such use cases as the automation of asset discovery and the ability to categorize those assets into hipaa groups for easy management and reporting. those same solutions may also perform vulnerability assessments, automate the prioritization of vulnerabilities for mitigation, and integrate with ticketing solutions to ensure the most critical are being remediated while overall risks are mitigated.step 3: take advantage of automated compliance reportingthe evaluation standard of hipaa requires covered entities to perform and document ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations to establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements.most solutions do not cover all the requirements defined by the hipaa audit protocol, but they will give you a jump on your hipaa checklist.many security management platforms also include additional predefined event reports, such as reports by data source and data source type, helping to make daily compliance monitoring and reporting activities more efficient.also, look for an intuitive and flexible interface that allows you to quickly search and analyze your security data, as well as the ability to create and save custom views and export them as executive-ready reports.finally, solutions that provide centralized visibility of your cloud and on-premises assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and log data from firewalls and other security tools are key to giving you the most complete and contextual data set for maintaining and documenting continuous compliance.step 4: implement monitoring and breach notification protocolsthe breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and business associates to provide notifications if they experience a breach that involves unsecured protected health information.security management platforms can help to simplify and automate monitoring for breaches on your network, ensuring you are able to more quickly detect and contain a breach, as well as provide the required notifications.as more organizations in healthcare are migrating data and applications to the cloud, make sure the technology you’re choosing offers advanced threat detection across both on-premises and multi-cloud environments. simplify compliance management by choosing a solution that combines an array of essential security capabilities in one platform. these may include, but are not limited to: asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, endpoint detection and response, siem event correlation, file integrity monitoring (fim), and log management. by combining these use cases in a single dashboard, you are better able to quickly identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats that target your ehr environment.intelligence it key to threat detection and incident response, so consider vendors who have in-house research teams as well as access to external threat intelligence communities and other sources that can provide insight into the latest global threats and vulnerabilities — and in particular, those that are specific to healthcare.however, intelligence without context will create lot of distracting “noise” for your team. so, check that the solution goes beyond just providing intelligence to incorporating it directly into your dashboard, including providing recommendations on how to respond to identified threats. with this intelligence and guidance at your fingertips, you can react quickly to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. and, you are assured of an always-up-to-date and optimally performing security monitoring solution.need more info on how to respond to a breach? see the hhs quick response checklist.step 5: continuously evaluate and manage riskwhether you are managing ongoing hipaa compliance internally or are using an external organization, avoid last-minute scrambling for annual evaluations and audits by employing a year-round risk management program. such a program requires having real-time visibility of your environment, including system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall information, and product upgrades.use a unified platform to gain this visibility and enable monitoring in a central location (opposed to various point solutions). here are a few examples of where a platform would be helpful for continuous risk and compliance management:examples: use automated asset discovery for on-premises and cloud environments and then create asset groups such as business critical assets or hipaa assets for ongoing monitoring, management and reporting. identify systems with known vulnerabilities and use correlation rules to detect threats.examples: monitor for successful and failed logon events to assets. monitor for communications with known malicious ip addresses or use file integrity monitoring (fim) to detect, assess and report on changes to system binaries, and content locations. schedule vulnerability scans, automate assessments, and plan for mitigation. review events and detected incidents.examples: aggregate events from across on-premises and multi-cloud environments. classify threats based on their risk level. monitor for stolen credentials, malware-based compromises such as communication to a known command and control (c&c) server, anomalous user and admin activities, file integrity, and vulnerabilities.example: automate forensics tasks to be executed in response to a detected threat and simplify forensics investigations with filters, search and reporting capabilities for event and log data. automate actions to contain threats, such as isolating systems from the network.use out-of-the box reporting to document that you’ve made an accurate assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic phi — and to quickly show the status of technical controls that align to hipaa or other regulations.maintaining adherence to hipaa is no small feat considering the dozens of criteria that are considered in the hipaa audit checklist. attempting to manage your compliance program manually and without the help of expert healthcare security consultants will not only take up massive amounts of time, it could result in your team missing an essential component of the regulation, or worse yet, enduring a breach that compromises patient data or takes down the network. however, with the right mix of people, processes and technology, it’s not an impossible to stay on top of compliance management while ensuring your network is secure and patient data protected year-round.hipaa regulationshipaa privacy rule: this rule set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by three types of covered entities: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and health care providers who conduct the standard healthcare transactions electronically.\\xa0hipaa security rule: this rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. the privacy rule is located at 45 cfr part 160 and subparts a and e of part 164\\xa0(e-phi).hipaa breach and notification rule: the hipaa breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information.tags: ransomware, risk management,

            "{'titel': 'slack phishing attacks using webhooks', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsslack is a cloud-based messaging platform that is commonly used in workplace communications. it is feature-rich, offering additional functionality such as video calling and screen sharing in addition to a marketplace containing thousands of third-party applications and add-ons.slack incoming webhooks allow you to post messages from your applications to slack. by specifying a unique url, your message body, and a destination channel, you can send a message to any webhook that you know the url for in any workspace, regardless of membership. webhooks take the format of https://hooks.slack.com/services/t00000000/b00000000/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.generally, slack webhooks are considered a low risk integration due to the following assumptions:a deeper dive into webhooks shows that this is not entirely accurate.first, a channel override allows you to override the previously specified webhook target channel by adding the “channel” key to your json payload. if you gain access to a webhook for one channel, you can use it in others. considering sending to #general, #engineering, and other default or common channels to target a wider audience.in some cases, this can also override channel posting permissions (such as admin-only posting).slack documentation suggests that allowed target channels are based on the original creator of the webhook: “posting_to_general_channel_denied is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the \"#general\" channel for a workspace where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. you\\'ll receive this error with a http 403.” so if you can find a webhook created by an admin - congrats, you can post to admin channels!a quick search on github shows 130,989 public code results containing slack webhook urls, with a majority containing the full unique webhook value.the last assumption is true - webhooks can only accept data. that’s where we get creative.the process itself is fairly simple:as mentioned earlier, github is a good start for scraping publicly committed webhook data.first, create an app. you will also need a web server to handle the oauth flow.slack apps don’t require oauth, but in this case we will be using the slack api to access data in workspaces where the malicious app is installed. when the user attempts to install the application, they must approve the requested oauth scopes. their approval is sent to the oauth client, which retrieves an access token from the authorization server. this access token may be used to retrieve data using the specified service scopes until authorization is revoked. read more about using oauth 2.0 here.you will also need to set your oauth scope(s) to whatever data you want to exfiltrate from slack. in my case, i chose files:read in order to access files on the victim\\'s workspace.your redirect url must be set to the oauth client url.the following code snippet can be used to handle the oauth 2.0 handshake using python and flask.the following payload will send a message to the #general channel associated with the unique webhook url. in this scenario, we’re claiming that the webhook configuration needs to be updated.payload:message:the link points to https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?scope=files:read&client_id=834500968371.846020497941, which is actually the shareable url for my malicious slack app.upon clicking, the user will be directed to install “webhook configuration”.at no point is it clear that the victim has interacted with any domain except for slack.com.after exchanging the temporary authorization code for the access token, you will receive a response from slack containing the access token in addition to some other data, including identifiers for the user, team, and enterprise they are part of.distribution statistics can also be tracked from your app’s distribution page at https://api.slack.com/apps/.once you receive the user’s access token, you are free to access data on their behalf. note that slack has mostly moved to using perspectival scopes, i.e. user tokens or bot tokens that give access within the context of that entity. what you can access depends on the requester access and the scopes that your app initially requested. in my example, files:read was used.the above request allows us to list all files that the user has access to, and subsequently download each of them using the access token and the private url returned by the files.list method.the example in this post shows a simple phishing and data exfiltration flow. in theory, this could also be used for propagation of attacks across users and workspaces.the chat.postmessage method allows you to send messages via channel or direct message. with the chat:write:user permission, messages can be sent as_user using the context of the user token. compromising one member of your workspace would allow more targeted or convincing malicious messages to be sent to channels they are part of or directly to their peers, similar to the high-profile gsuite phishing attack in 2018 which was also covered by us in a previous blog post.users of shared channels can direct message users participating in the shared channels across workspaces. targeting those users would allow for compromise across multiple workspaces.application whitelistingadministrators have the option to manage their users’ slack applications. in less sensitive workspaces, this may involve only allowing apps from the app directory. applications added to the directory are required to go through slack’s own app security review process prior to approval.more sensitive environments may call for application whitelisting/application approval, requiring an administrator to review and approve applications before installation. this option is strongly recommended for companies looking to comply with ccpa, gdpr, and other regulations that require tracking of sharing of personal data with third parties.detection of suspicious oauth applicationsif whitelisting is not an option or you’d like an extra layer of defense, you may be interested in detecting suspicious slack oauth applications that users are adding to your workspace. by ingesting slack audit log data into a security analytics platform such as usm anywhere, one can alert on these suspicious actions.for example, some items of interest might include:see more on the event actions that can be monitored in slack’s official documentation.some mitigations could only be implemented by slack.implement least privilege for incoming webhookswebhooks should default to only working in the defined channel. multi-channel webhooks/overrides should be a separate application or opt-in setting. since the override feature is nested under a “setup instructions” pane that requires user interaction to display, many users are not aware of it. webhooks should not be able to post to announcement-only/admin-only channels unless that channel is explicitly defined in the webhook configuration.improved awareness of secrets handlingnone of the text on the incoming webhook configuration page asserts the importance of secure storage of the webhook url. this issue paired with the hidden “features” of incoming webhooks may lead to users assuming low-to-no risk associated with webhooks, as is supported by the frequency of webhooks publicly committed.application verificationapps that have not been reviewed by slack and are not local to the workspace should have limited functionality or require further verification. consider a process similar to the google oauth verification process, where unverified apps using high-risk scopes require additional developer identity verification and/or are capped to a certain number of users to avoid widespread abuse.webhooks are credential tools that provide access to posting functionality within a workspace.\\xa0though data cannot be exposed through webhooks on slack, we do recommend that workspace owners or admins invalidate publicly exposed webhook urls and generate new ones. to help slack admins with that diligence, we\\xa0proactively scrape github for publicly exposed webhooks and invalidate them. webhooks are safe as long as they remain secret since the webhook url itself is unguessable.\\xa0we also recommend workspace owners and admins use\\xa0these best practices\\xa0for storing credentials safely and that they review\\xa0this guide\\xa0to sending messages using incoming webhooks.we also provide additional features to support the proper oversight of app installation and usage within workspaces, which help workspace owners and admins protect their workspaces. we allow teams to require admin approvals on all apps, and recommend they establish and follow basic security diligence procedures before permitting apps to be added into a workspace. our security recommendations for approving apps can be found\\xa0here.tags: phishing, slack, webhooksinsights reportat&t cybersecurity

            "{'titel': 'the rise of qakbot', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was jointly written with ofer caspi. some of the links in this blog require an otx account, and the qakbot infrastructure tracker will require readers to be customers with access to the threat intel subscription.. thanks to the following researchers and the malwarebazaar project:at&t alien labs closely monitors the evolution of crimeware such as the qakbot\\xa0(also known as qbot) malware family and campaigns in connection with qakbot. the jointly coordinated takedown of the actors behind emotet in late january has left a gap in the cybercrime landscape, which qakbot seems poised to fill.key points:qakbot, also known as qbot or pinkslipbot, is a modular information stealer. it has been active since 2007 and primarily used by financially motivated actors. it was initially known as a banking trojan and a loader using c2 servers for payload delivery; however, its use expanded beyond strictly being a banking trojan. the hallmarks of a qakbot infection chain consist of a phishing lure (t1566) delivered via email chain hijacking or spoofed emails that contain context-aware information such as shipping, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, claims, etc. the phishing emails alternate between file attachments (t1566.001) and links (t1566.002). qakbot is often used as a gateway entry, similar to trickbot or emotet, that leads to post exploitation operations leveraging frameworks such as cobalt strike as well as delivering ransomware.qakbot email lures are not the most sophisticated; however, by using contextually aware themes that originate from hijacked email chains or potentially compromised accounts within a user’s social circle, they are effective. figure 1 below illustrates an example of a recent qakbot lure with the subject “re: signed quote” and a zip file attachment labeled “cancellation_letter_272020508-02242021.zip”.figure 1. qakbot \"signed quote\" email lurethe actors further establish the trust and confidence of the targeted user by presenting a semi-official looking docusign graphic that guides the user through the process of enabling the excel 4 macros. a representative sample, 78ea3550e2697cd06b07df568242f7fc9f57e4d2b297b74f6ce26e97613de53a, seen in a recent qakbot campaign is shown in figure 2 below.figure 2. qakbot docusign lureqakbot excel spreadsheets often contain hidden spreadsheets, excel 4.0 macros, spreadsheet formulas, and biff records all designed to pass a visual inspection from the user with the added benefit of bypassing detection mechanisms that attempt to parse multiple legacy formats inside the spreadsheet. figure 3 below shows a screenshot of output from the open-source xlmmacrodeobfuscator tool, which decodes obfuscated excel 4.0 macros.figure 3. xlmmacrodeobfuscator output for a qakbot excel 4.0 macro spreadsheetonce the excel 4.0 macro is decoded it is possible to see the call to urldownloadtofilea, which downloads the qakbot dll in this campaign from http[:]//rlyrt26rnxw02vqijgs[.]com/fera/frid[.]gif. next, the exec function is evaluated which executes “rundll32.exe nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver”. it is also a common tactic for qakbot to execute “regsvr32.exe -s nxckew.wle,dllregisterserver”. both instances are designed to evade sandbox environments that do not supply the expected command line arguments. a representative qakbot dll analyzed by alien labs, 9a353d4b85b3097762282703f1807c2b459698966b967280c8e4e13cc56d2e28, has two exports: the entry point (0x10005a5d) and dllregisterserver (0x10029c88)and if dllregisterserver is not called via regsvr32.exe or rundll32.exe with command line options, then only the entry point is called and the malicious code in dllregisterserver is not called. figure 3 below shows improved readability and de-obfuscation of the macro by manually replacing and substituting the cell values and formulas.figure 3. better de-obfuscation of the spreadsheetthe results of our additional de-obfuscation efforts are confirmed when the qakbot excel spreadsheet is run inside a sandbox in figure 4 below.figure 4. otx screenshot showing the “rundll32 ..\\\\nxckew.wle, dllregisterserver\\'\\' executionbefore executing the main payload, the qakbot loader will first test the infected system to see if it is a good candidate for infection. the qakbot loader is responsible for checking its environment to include whether it is running on a virtual machine, identifying any installed and running security and monitoring tools such as antivirus products or common security researcher tools. figure 5 below shows a high-level execution flow of the qakbot loader.figure 5. qakbot execution flowto make detection and analysis harder, qakbot encrypts its strings and decrypts them at runtime before use. once the qakbot execution logic is finished using a string, it will immediately delete the string from memory. an example of this can be seen in figure 6 below, which shows qakbot decrypting a string containing the value for lpprocname passed as a parameter to the getprocaddress api call. the selected function, which has been labeled in ida pro as, “oc_clear_mem” deletes the string memory right after it retrieves the process address.figure 6. qakbot getprocaddress and clear_mem routineswhen executed, qakbot will check whether it has previously been executed on the machine by checking for the specified malware folder. if qakbot discovers it is a first time run, it will relaunch itself from cmd.exe with the /c parameter that will inform the loader to proceed and run its anti-vm checks on the machine and return the results to the parent process. if qakbot detects it is running in a vm environment, then the final payload will not be decrypted since qakbot uses the return value from these checks in its final decryption routine. figure 7 below shows the qakbot environment check logic.figure 7. qakbot environment check logicspecifically, qakbot checks the system for the names of running processes that match the strings listed in table 1 below.process namesfigure 8 below shows the decryption routine for the security and monitoring tool strings (t1140).figure 8. qakbot decrypting tool check stringsqakbot will also add its folder to the windows defender exclusions setting located in the registry (t1112), which prevents defender from scanning qakbot artifacts. the registry location can be seen in figure 9 below.figure 9. qakbot adding exclusion paths to windows defender settingsin addition to the previously mentioned environment check, qakbot collects system information (t1082) such as computer name, system directories, user profiles, and more, which is shown in figure 10 below.figure 10. qakbot system information collectionqakbot will use process hollowing (t1055.012) in order to inject itself into explorer.exe. if it is unsuccessful then qakbot will attempt to inject itself into mobsync.exe or iexplore.exe. the screen shot in figure 11 illustrates the qakbot process name decryption routine.\\xa0figure 11. qakbot routine to decrypt process names for injectionfigure 12 below shows the qakbot logic to overwrite the suspended explorer.exe process and then resume its execution.figure 12. qakbot process hollowing routineadditionally, qakbot abuses the service control manager (scm) to create a child process, which is then detached from the parent when the scm terminates the parent process. qakbot c2 communications begin in this stage to make it more difficult to monitor. figure 13 below shows the scm spawned process abuse technique.figure 13. qakbot abusing scm to spawn a detached processfigure 14 below shows the qakbot c2 ping during the scm interaction.figure 14. qakbot sending c2 pingfinally, if the qakbot loader has verified its execution environment has passed its tests, then qakbot will proceed to decrypt and execute the main qakbot payload, which is hidden as resource “307”. the decryption and import table resolution of its main payload is shown in figure 15 below.figure 15. qakbot decryption and import table resolution of main payloadthe combined anti-analysis and evasion techniques across the infection chain significantly impair antivirus, edr, and other security defenses from detecting and preventing the initial infection. despite the limitations and challenges presented by qakbot dlls there is ample opportunity to detect qakbot loaders signed by revoked and blacklisted malicious certificates. alien labs has identified 42 unique signers and signature serial numbers, which are included in detection methods section to aid in detection and hunting with yara and osquery. additionally, there are a number of behavioral patterns, indicators of behavior (iob), which provide opportunities for detection.alien labs has observed qakbot over the past three months being used in a role similar to trickbot, which includes malspam delivery, stealthy maldocs dropping signed loaders, establishing a foothold, and finally post exploitation activities such as lateral movement, access operations, and ransomware delivery. alien labs actively tracks the qakbot c2 infrastructure for customers, which is available via otx here.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by

            "{'titel': 'teamtnt delivers malware with new detection evasion tool', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsat&t alien labs™ has identified a new tool from the teamtnt adversary group, which has been previously observed targeting exposed docker infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining purposes and credential theft. the group is using a new detection evasion tool, copied from open source repositories.the purpose of this blog\\xa0is to share new technical intelligence and provide detection and analysis options for defenders.at&t alien labs previously reported on teamtnt cryptomining malware using a new memory loader based on ezuri and written in golang. since then, teamtnt has added another tool to their list of capabilities.the objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.the tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on github, described as \"hide a process under linux using the ld preloader.\\'\\' preloading allows the system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. if the custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the system libraries, the custom version will override it.the tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.the new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the teamtnt cryptominer binary or ircbot (figure 1):figure 1. base64 encoded script, via alien labs analysis.upon binary execution, the bash script will run through a multitude of tasks. specifically, the script will:after decoding, we can observe the bash script functionality and how some malicious activity occurs before the shared library is created (figure 2):figure 2. decoded bash script, via alien labs analysis.the new tool is first dropped as a hidden tar file on disk, the script decompresses it, writes it to \\'/usr/local/lib/systemhealt.so\\', and then adds it preload via \\'/etc/ld.so.preload\\'. this will be used by the system to preload the file before other system libraries, allowing the attacker to override some common functions (figure 3/4).figure 3/4. bash script features, via alien labs analysis.the main purpose of the tool is to hide the teamtnt bot from process viewer tools, which use the file \\'/usr/bin/sbin\\' as you can see in figure 3 and 4 (setup_ircbot function).as final step, the malware will remove traces by deleting bash history:figure 5. bash script cleanup, via alien labs analysis.through the use of libprocesshider, teamtnt once again expands their capabilities based on the available open source tools. while the new functionality of libprocesshider is to evade detection and other basic functions, it acts as an indicator to consider when hunting for malicious activity on the host level. alien labs will continue to monitor the threat and report on any noteworthy activity.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional

            "{'titel': 'malware using new ezuri memory loader', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was written by ofer caspi and fernando martinez of at&t alien labsmultiple threat actors have recently started using a go language (golang) tool to act as a packer and avoid antivirus detection. additionally, the ezuri memory loader tool acts as a malware loader and executes its payload in memory, without writing the file to disk. while this technique is known and commonly used by windows malware, it is less popular in linux environments. the loader decrypts the malicious malware and executes it using memfd create (as described in this blog in 2018). when creating a process, the system returns a file descriptor to an anonymous file in \\'/proc/pid/fd/\\' which is visible only in the filesystem.figure 1 shows a code snippet from the loader, containing the information it uses in order to decrypt the payload using the aes algorithm. figure 1. loader code snippet via alien labs analysis.the loader, written in golang, is taken from the \"ezuri\" code on github via the user guitmz. this user originally created the elf loader around march 2019, when he wrote a blog about the technique to run elf executables from memory and shared the loader on his github. additionally, a similar user ‘tmz’ (presumably associated with the previously mentioned ‘guitmz’) posted this same code in late august, on a small forum where malware samples are shared.the guitmz user even ran tests against virustotal to prove the efficiency of the code, uploading a detected linux.cephei sample (35308b8b770d2d4f78299262f595a0769e55152cb432d0efc42292db01609a18) with 30/61 av detections in virustotal, compared to the zero av detections by the same sample hidden with the ezuri code (ddbb714157f2ef91c1ec350cdf1d1f545290967f61491404c81b4e6e52f5c41f).the execution flow of the loader is to first decrypt the payload and then execute it from memory (figure 2):figure 2. execution flow, retrieved from alien labs analysis.guitmz gave this sample the name ezuri, probably after the card with the same name from the card game “magic: the gathering.” \\xa0this card has the capability to “regenerate another target elf,” reflecting the \\xa0malware’s capability of loading and executing an elf file in memory.at&t alien labs team accessed guitmz’s upload of code for analysis. the tool is written in golang and is intuitive to use. when executing, it first asks the path for the payload to be encrypted, along with the password to be used for aes encryption. if no password is given, the tool generates one, which is used to hide the malware within the loader. after the user\\'s input, the packer compiles the loader with the payload encrypted within it, so it can be decrypted and executed in memory once it is placed in the victim’s system. figure 4 shows the main function of the executable, where the file is first decrypted by “aesdec” to then be run in memory by “runfrommemory”. figure 3 shows ezuri main function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.figure 4 shows the “runfrommemory” function used to execute the payload in memory without placing the detectable malware on disk.figure 4 shows ezuri runfrommemory function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.to use the tool, the user will be requested to enter the file to be hidden, with a target process name as well as an optional aes key for encryption (figure 5):figure 5 shows ezuri execution, retrieved from alien labs analysis.at&t alien labs has identified several malware authors leveraging the ezuri loader in the last few months, including teamtnt, which was the first identified. teamtnt is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least april 2020, when the security firm trend micro first reported on them. the main focus of the group is to target docker systems with misconfigurations, as well as unprotected and exposed management apis, to later install ddos bots and cryptominers in the infected systems. a few months after the trend micro report, in august 2020, cado security found new developments in the teamtnt group. in october 2020, palo alto networks unit42 identified new variants of the cryptomining malware used by teamtnt named “black-t.” this sample first installs three network scanners, and then inspects memory in an attempt to retrieve any type of credentials located in the memory. additionally, unit42 identified several german-language strings in some of the tnt scripts.the last sample identified by palo alto networks unit42 is actually an ezuri loader. the decrypted payload is an elf file packed with upx, which is a known sample from teamtnt, first seen in june 2020 (e15550481e89dbd154b875ce50cc5af4b49f9ff7b837d9ac5b5594e5d63966a3).the techniques and code similarities between the original tool, named ezuri, and the one recently used by teamtnt are vast. the most evident one being the \\'ezuri\\' string in the compiled binary (figure 6):figure 6 shows ezuri string in teamtnt\\xa0sample retrieved from alien labs analysis.using this packer, the antivirus (av) detection drops dramatically. looking at the teamtnt malware detections before using ezuri packer (b494ca3b7bae2ab9a5197b81e928baae5b8eac77dfdc7fe1223fee8f27024772), we see 28/62 av detections of the malware, while the ezuri packed version (751014e0154d219dea8c2e999714c32fd98f817782588cd7af355d2488eb1c80) drops to only 3/64 av detections.in addition to teamtnt, there were several gafgyt samples observed (popular iot device malware with ddos attacks purposes). several malware authors have been using an open source golang tool to act as a malware loader, using a known technique to load the elf binaries into memory and avoid using easy-to-detect files on disk. the authors use the open source tool ezuri, to load its previously seen payloads and avoid antivirus detections on the file. the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe

the purpose of this blog is to provide additional technical details and an in-depth study of the signed trickbot bazarloader.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0since trickbot was discovered in 2016 it has been involved in information stealing, credential theft, ransomware, bitcoin mining, and loading other common crimeware malware as a first or second stage loader. for initial access as a first stage loader it typically accomplishes its objective through spear phishing links (t1192) or spear phishing attachments (t1193) using macro enabled microsoft office files. as a second stage payload and dynamic link library (dll) it is frequently loaded by emotet. to a lesser extent trickbot has been loaded by ostap javascript downloader and buer loader. in higher priority, higher profile trickbot anchor campaigns that target enterprises, powertrick and more_eggs/terraloader have been used to load other frameworks.trickbot has recently added a remote desktop protocol (rdp) brute force scanner module, an active directory (ad) harvesting module, and the mexec executor module. there are some indications that trickbot may be moving away from their mshare, mworm, and tabdll modules for retrieving payloads from urls in favor of the “nworm” module performing this task. it is important to note that trickbot group prefers to use shellcode “file-less” modules making detection more difficult.alien labs has previously identified digitally signed trickbot loaders, one of which was signed by an entity named “vb corporate pty. ltd.” pivoting in virustotal on the signer shows the first submission was on 2020-01-02 20:24:57. historically, the trickbot group has continued to reuse their revoked certificates to sign trickbot loaders as long as six months after the initial date of detection on virustotal. a list of known trickbot signers is included below. the associated signature serial numbers are included in the yara rule in the appendix.the trickbot bazarloader authors have produced an advanced module, with a significant amount of obfuscation. the bazarloader/cryptor uses multiple routines to hide api calls and embedded strings, which are then decrypted and resolved at runtime. once executed, the loader will allocate memory to store and decrypt its shellcode, which will be allocated to a numa node for faster execution. after allocation and decryption, the next instructions will jump to the shellcode that will be executed on the heap.next, the malware will try to communicate with .bazar domain c2 servers. once the c2 has been established, the loader will try to inject its payload into a system process using the process hollowing technique (t1093), which will create a suspended thread, unmap the destination image from memory, allocate new memory in the target process, copy the shellcode into the target process, set the thread context, and resume the process. in the sample analyzed, 1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83, the loader will first attempt to inject into an “svchost” process, and if injection fails, it will try to inject into the “explorer.exe” process, and if injection fails again as a last-ditch effort the loader will attempt to inject into the “cmd.exe” process. for persistence the loader will create a registry key under “hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\winlogon\\\\userinit”.the malware uses the windows api “virtualallocexnuma” function to allocate memory for its shellcode to be executed. the “virtualallocexnuma” function is used to allocate memory on a numa node, which allows for faster execution. the implementation can be seen in figure 1 below. it is interesting to note that the “virtualallocexnuma” function is not commonly used in process injection.figure 1. api resolution and shellcode decryption routinesin figure 1 above the bazarloader allocates memory using the uncommon “virtualallocexnuma” routine, and then it uses two iterations of the decryption routine to decrypt its shellcode. in the second call to the decrypt function some of the encryption key bytes are changed based on function parameters. in figure 2 below a representation of the decompiled decrypt routine can be seen importing the encryption key, modifying the encryption key bytes dependent on the parameters passed, and then decrypting the data.figure 2. decryption routinethe bazarloader authors have created dozens of decryption routines, and with almost each string including apis, dlls, and c2s there is a once per use unique decryption routine. an example of multiple decryption routines can be seen in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 below.figure 3. decryption routinefigure 4. decryption routinefigure 5. decryption routinethe loader uses the same decryption technique described above to resolve the api calls it uses during execution. the windows api resolution can be seen in figure 6 below.figure 6. windows api resolutionfor injection, the malware resolves apis from the ntdll.dll after it loads from disk and checks that there are no inline hooks within its function, that could be created for example by av software that tracks those api calls.the targeted processes for injection can be seen in figure 7 below.figure 7. targeted svchost, explorer, and cmd windows processes\\xa0the bazarloader injection code can be seen

            "{'titel': 'a hipaa compliance checklist', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsmaintaining security and compliance with hipaa, the health insurance portability and accountability act, is growing ever more challenging. the networks that house protected health information (phi or ephi) are becoming larger and more complex — especially as organizations move data to the cloud. at the same time, security professionals are faced with an evolving threat landscape of increasingly sophisticated threat actors and methods of attack.for example, 2018 threat intelligence research by at&t alien\\xa0labs reports a rise in the number of targeted ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. these attacks are often backed by organized criminals who see opportunities for making money from health care providers and other similar entities who must protect and keep assets, systems, and networks continuously operating.one such criminal group operating the samsam ransomware is thought to have earned more than $5 million dollars by manually compromising critical healthcare networks. and, according to alienvault labs, the methods used by samsam are more akin to a targeted attack than typical opportunistic ransomware.to help address these security challenges and ensure adherence to compliance mandates, security and it professionals should consider how people, processes, and technology can be used together to create a holistic it security compliance program that simplifies preparation, auditing and reporting, as well as ongoing security risk management and breach monitoring and response. here’s a five-step hipaa compliance checklist to get started.certification and ongoing hipaa compliancehipaa sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. any entity that deals with protected health information must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. in 2009, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act was adopted to promote the “meaningful use of health information technology” and address the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information. although there is no standard or implementation specification that requires a covered entity to “certify” compliance, the evaluation standard § 164.308(a)(8) requires covered entities to perform ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations that establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements. evaluations can be performed and documented internally or by an external organization that provides evaluation or “certification” services. however, hitech requires the hhs office for civil rights (ocr) to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the hipaa privacy, security, and breach notification rules.step 1: start with a comprehensive risk assessment and gap analysisyour compliance strategy should start with a solid foundation, which is why the first step in your journey to hipaa compliance should be a readiness assessment that includes a comprehensive risk and compliance analysis of your electronic health record (ehr) environment. this assessment is often best done by a third party with expertise in healthcare security and compliance, as hipaa regulations can be confusing and cumbersome. using a third party with the necessary expertise will ensure you don’t miss or misunderstand the required regulations, and it will save you time as they will likely have a hipaa checklist to reference.\\xa0your consultant can perform an initial evaluation of your entire security program to determine its adherence to hipaa regulations and the level of readiness to proceed with the “certification” process. it’s worth noting that the ocr does not actually “certify” hipaa compliance (see side bar), however there are organizations outside of the ocr that do provide “certification” services, and many organizations take advantage of these certification services to prove compliance. as a result of the evaluation, your consultant should provide a comprehensive report that may include such things as:according to the ocr, organizations that have aligned their security programs to the national institute for standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework may find it helpful as a starting place to identify potential gaps in their compliance with the hipaa security rule. addressing these gaps can bolster compliance with the security rule and improve the organization’s ability to secure ephi and other critical information and business processes. read how nist “maps” to the hipaa security rule in the hipaa security rule crosswalk to nist cybersecurity framework.step 2: remediate identified risks and address compliance gapsonce you’ve identified your organization’s risks, take immediate steps to address the gaps within your security program. again, a consultant who has practical experience in healthcare security will be very useful in providing strategic guidance, as well as advice on risk mitigation. many organizations use the same consultant who performed their initial risk assessment.your consultant may develop specific programs, policies, standards, and procedures, as well as support or help implement key security practices and controls. for example, they may assist in prioritizing vulnerabilities and make recommendations for remediation in your ehr environment. or, they may provide pre-packaged employee security awareness training that meets hipaa guidelines, such as educating employees on security risks and running them through attack scenarios.make use of security technology to help you more quickly address the gaps in your compliance program — and consider platforms versus point solutions, giving you the ability to address multiple issues at once. also, look for solutions that address both on-premises and multi-cloud environments as hipaa regulations apply to both (see guidance on hipaa & cloud computing).\\xa0for example, look for such use cases as the automation of asset discovery and the ability to categorize those assets into hipaa groups for easy management and reporting. those same solutions may also perform vulnerability assessments, automate the prioritization of vulnerabilities for mitigation, and integrate with ticketing solutions to ensure the most critical are being remediated while overall risks are mitigated.step 3: take advantage of automated compliance reportingthe evaluation standard of hipaa requires covered entities to perform and document ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations to establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements.most solutions do not cover all the requirements defined by the hipaa audit protocol, but they will give you a jump on your hipaa checklist.many security management platforms also include additional predefined event reports, such as reports by data source and data source type, helping to make daily compliance monitoring and reporting activities more efficient.also, look for an intuitive and flexible interface that allows you to quickly search and analyze your security data, as well as the ability to create and save custom views and export them as executive-ready reports.finally, solutions that provide centralized visibility of your cloud and on-premises assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and log data from firewalls and other security tools are key to giving you the most complete and contextual data set for maintaining and documenting continuous compliance.step 4: implement monitoring and breach notification protocolsthe breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and business associates to provide notifications if they experience a breach that involves unsecured protected health information.security management platforms can help to simplify and automate monitoring for breaches on your network, ensuring you are able to more quickly detect and contain a breach, as well as provide the required notifications.as more organizations in healthcare are migrating data and applications to the cloud, make sure the technology you’re choosing offers advanced threat detection across both on-premises and multi-cloud environments. simplify compliance management by choosing a solution that combines an array of essential security capabilities in one platform. these may include, but are not limited to: asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, endpoint detection and response, siem event correlation, file integrity monitoring (fim), and log management. by combining these use cases in a single dashboard, you are better able to quickly identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats that target your ehr environment.intelligence it key to threat detection and incident response, so consider vendors who have in-house research teams as well as access to external threat intelligence communities and other sources that can provide insight into the latest global threats and vulnerabilities — and in particular, those that are specific to healthcare.however, intelligence without context will create lot of distracting “noise” for your team. so, check that the solution goes beyond just providing intelligence to incorporating it directly into your dashboard, including providing recommendations on how to respond to identified threats. with this intelligence and guidance at your fingertips, you can react quickly to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. and, you are assured of an always-up-to-date and optimally performing security monitoring solution.need more info on how to respond to a breach? see the hhs quick response checklist.step 5: continuously evaluate and manage riskwhether you are managing ongoing hipaa compliance internally or are using an external organization, avoid last-minute scrambling for annual evaluations and audits by employing a year-round risk management program. such a program requires having real-time visibility of your environment, including system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall information, and product upgrades.use a unified platform to gain this visibility and enable monitoring in a central location (opposed to various point solutions). here are a few examples of where a platform would be helpful for continuous risk and compliance management:examples: use automated asset discovery for on-premises and cloud environments and then create asset groups such as business critical assets or hipaa assets for ongoing monitoring, management and reporting. identify systems with known vulnerabilities and use correlation rules to detect threats.examples: monitor for successful and failed logon events to assets. monitor for communications with known malicious ip addresses or use file integrity monitoring (fim) to detect, assess and report on changes to system binaries, and content locations. schedule vulnerability scans, automate assessments, and plan for mitigation. review events and detected incidents.examples: aggregate events from across on-premises and multi-cloud environments. classify threats based on their risk level. monitor for stolen credentials, malware-based compromises such as communication to a known command and control (c&c) server, anomalous user and admin activities, file integrity, and vulnerabilities.example: automate forensics tasks to be executed in response to a detected threat and simplify forensics investigations with filters, search and reporting capabilities for event and log data. automate actions to contain threats, such as isolating systems from the network.use out-of-the box reporting to document that you’ve made an accurate assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic phi — and to quickly show the status of technical controls that align to hipaa or other regulations.maintaining adherence to hipaa is no small feat considering the dozens of criteria that are considered in the hipaa audit checklist. attempting to manage your compliance program manually and without the help of expert healthcare security consultants will not only take up massive amounts of time, it could result in your team missing an essential component of the regulation, or worse yet, enduring a breach that compromises patient data or takes down the network. however, with the right mix of people, processes and technology, it’s not an impossible to stay on top of compliance management while ensuring your network is secure and patient data protected year-round.hipaa regulationshipaa privacy rule: this rule set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by three types of covered entities: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and health care providers who conduct the standard healthcare transactions electronically.\\xa0hipaa security rule: this rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. the privacy rule is located at 45 cfr part 160 and subparts a and e of part 164\\xa0(e-phi).hipaa breach and notification rule: the hipaa breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information.tags: ransomware, risk management,

            "{'titel': 'slack phishing attacks using webhooks', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsslack is a cloud-based messaging platform that is commonly used in workplace communications. it is feature-rich, offering additional functionality such as video calling and screen sharing in addition to a marketplace containing thousands of third-party applications and add-ons.slack incoming webhooks allow you to post messages from your applications to slack. by specifying a unique url, your message body, and a destination channel, you can send a message to any webhook that you know the url for in any workspace, regardless of membership. webhooks take the format of https://hooks.slack.com/services/t00000000/b00000000/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.generally, slack webhooks are considered a low risk integration due to the following assumptions:a deeper dive into webhooks shows that this is not entirely accurate.first, a channel override allows you to override the previously specified webhook target channel by adding the “channel” key to your json payload. if you gain access to a webhook for one channel, you can use it in others. considering sending to #general, #engineering, and other default or common channels to target a wider audience.in some cases, this can also override channel posting permissions (such as admin-only posting).slack documentation suggests that allowed target channels are based on the original creator of the webhook: “posting_to_general_channel_denied is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the \"#general\" channel for a workspace where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. you\\'ll receive this error with a http 403.” so if you can find a webhook created by an admin - congrats, you can post to admin channels!a quick search on github shows 130,989 public code results containing slack webhook urls, with a majority containing the full unique webhook value.the last assumption is true - webhooks can only accept data. that’s where we get creative.the process itself is fairly simple:as mentioned earlier, github is a good start for scraping publicly committed webhook data.first, create an app. you will also need a web server to handle the oauth flow.slack apps don’t require oauth, but in this case we will be using the slack api to access data in workspaces where the malicious app is installed. when the user attempts to install the application, they must approve the requested oauth scopes. their approval is sent to the oauth client, which retrieves an access token from the authorization server. this access token may be used to retrieve data using the specified service scopes until authorization is revoked. read more about using oauth 2.0 here.you will also need to set your oauth scope(s) to whatever data you want to exfiltrate from slack. in my case, i chose files:read in order to access files on the victim\\'s workspace.your redirect url must be set to the oauth client url.the following code snippet can be used to handle the oauth 2.0 handshake using python and flask.the following payload will send a message to the #general channel associated with the unique webhook url. in this scenario, we’re claiming that the webhook configuration needs to be updated.payload:message:the link points to https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?scope=files:read&client_id=834500968371.846020497941, which is actually the shareable url for my malicious slack app.upon clicking, the user will be directed to install “webhook configuration”.at no point is it clear that the victim has interacted with any domain except for slack.com.after exchanging the temporary authorization code for the access token, you will receive a response from slack containing the access token in addition to some other data, including identifiers for the user, team, and enterprise they are part of.distribution statistics can also be tracked from your app’s distribution page at https://api.slack.com/apps/.once you receive the user’s access token, you are free to access data on their behalf. note that slack has mostly moved to using perspectival scopes, i.e. user tokens or bot tokens that give access within the context of that entity. what you can access depends on the requester access and the scopes that your app initially requested. in my example, files:read was used.the above request allows us to list all files that the user has access to, and subsequently download each of them using the access token and the private url returned by the files.list method.the example in this post shows a simple phishing and data exfiltration flow. in theory, this could also be used for propagation of attacks across users and workspaces.the chat.postmessage method allows you to send messages via channel or direct message. with the chat:write:user permission, messages can be sent as_user using the context of the user token. compromising one member of your workspace would allow more targeted or convincing malicious messages to be sent to channels they are part of or directly to their peers, similar to the high-profile gsuite phishing attack in 2018 which was also covered by us in a previous blog post.users of shared channels can direct message users participating in the shared channels across workspaces. targeting those users would allow for compromise across multiple workspaces.application whitelistingadministrators have the option to manage their users’ slack applications. in less sensitive workspaces, this may involve only allowing apps from the app directory. applications added to the directory are required to go through slack’s own app security review process prior to approval.more sensitive environments may call for application whitelisting/application approval, requiring an administrator to review and approve applications before installation. this option is strongly recommended for companies looking to comply with ccpa, gdpr, and other regulations that require tracking of sharing of personal data with third parties.detection of suspicious oauth applicationsif whitelisting is not an option or you’d like an extra layer of defense, you may be interested in detecting suspicious slack oauth applications that users are adding to your workspace. by ingesting slack audit log data into a security analytics platform such as usm anywhere, one can alert on these suspicious actions.for example, some items of interest might include:see more on the event actions that can be monitored in slack’s official documentation.some mitigations could only be implemented by slack.implement least privilege for incoming webhookswebhooks should default to only working in the defined channel. multi-channel webhooks/overrides should be a separate application or opt-in setting. since the override feature is nested under a “setup instructions” pane that requires user interaction to display, many users are not aware of it. webhooks should not be able to post to announcement-only/admin-only channels unless that channel is explicitly defined in the webhook configuration.improved awareness of secrets handlingnone of the text on the incoming webhook configuration page asserts the importance of secure storage of the webhook url. this issue paired with the hidden “features” of incoming webhooks may lead to users assuming low-to-no risk associated with webhooks, as is supported by the frequency of webhooks publicly committed.application verificationapps that have not been reviewed by slack and are not local to the workspace should have limited functionality or require further verification. consider a process similar to the google oauth verification process, where unverified apps using high-risk scopes require additional developer identity verification and/or are capped to a certain number of users to avoid widespread abuse.webhooks are credential tools that provide access to posting functionality within a workspace.\\xa0though data cannot be exposed through webhooks on slack, we do recommend that workspace owners or admins invalidate publicly exposed webhook urls and generate new ones. to help slack admins with that diligence, we\\xa0proactively scrape github for publicly exposed webhooks and invalidate them. webhooks are safe as long as they remain secret since the webhook url itself is unguessable.\\xa0we also recommend workspace owners and admins use\\xa0these best practices\\xa0for storing credentials safely and that they review\\xa0this guide\\xa0to sending messages using incoming webhooks.we also provide additional features to support the proper oversight of app installation and usage within workspaces, which help workspace owners and admins protect their workspaces. we allow teams to require admin approvals on all apps, and recommend they establish and follow basic security diligence procedures before permitting apps to be added into a workspace. our security recommendations for approving apps can be found\\xa0here.tags: phishing, slack, webhooksinsights reportat&t cybersecurity

            "{'titel': 'security monitoring for managed cloud kubernetes', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsphoto by\\xa0chuttersnap\\xa0on\\xa0unsplashkubernetes (k8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. it has recently seen rapid adoption across enterprise environments.many environments rely on managed kubernetes services such as google kubernetes engine (gke) and amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) to take advantage of the benefits of both containerization and the cloud. google cloud platform, for example, offers advanced cluster management features such as automatic upgrades, load balancing, and stackdriver logging. amazon web services (aws) provides kubernetes(r) role based access control (rbac) integration with aws iam authenticator and logging via cloudtrail and cloudwatch.however, adoption of these cloud-managed services can introduce new challenges to your monitoring and detection capabilities, such as:the purpose of this post and associated release is to help fill in the detection gaps between kubernetes, eks, and gke, and provide normalized detection strategies that include multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.with their advanced features, cloud-managed services add potential and new attack vectors as well as room for error or confusion.kubernetes itself is highly complex; trail of bits recently published a security assessment of the kubernetes platform. the intent of the audit was to identify and document existing risks and vulnerabilities of the platform, ultimately providing recommendations to improve its security posture.the assessment team found configuration and deployment of kubernetes to be non-trivial, with certain components having “confusing default settings, missing operational controls, and implicitly defined security controls”. this presents a need to understand the vulnerabilities and limitations of the platform itself, in addition to passing a high technical barrier of entry.each managed cloud service may remediate these issues differently (or not at all). according to google, “the report also calls out kubernetes’ default settings. in gke, we’ve been actively changing these over time, including turning off abac and basic authentication by default, to make sure new clusters you create are more secure.”\\xa0 abac is attribute-based access control.insecure defaults may have inconsistent fixes between managed platforms, and new protections may not apply to earlier versions. a well-intentioned administrator may also re-enable insecure settings to restore previous functionality or compatibility.because of this, our new detections are focused not only on potential attacks but on environmental awareness with an emphasis on multi-cloud support.managed services such as amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) and google kubernetes engine (gke) use a shared responsibility model which describe the role of security of the cloud and security in the cloud (see: the gke shared responsibility model versus eks).the good news is that this model clearly defines things that aren’t your responsibility - like the underlying infrastructure, the etcd database, and control plane nodes. the bad news is that you also need to understand what you are responsible for in order to implement the proper security monitoring and controls, and this includes platform-specific implementations such as defining and protecting your security groups or iam roles.api server flags, security control defaults, and the kubernetes patch version may also be considered in their purview for new systems, while any modifications to that or continued use of legacy systems become yours. through correlation rules you are able to better track these security regressions.logs are the foundation of security monitoring and the key to understanding who is doing what on your systems. usm anywhere supports log collection for aws, gcp, and azure, which significantly expedites the collection and normalization of log data.in addition to the kubernetes control plane logs, you should also remember to monitor the associated api logs for the cloud services such as api calls to eks or gke.for cloud-managed kubernetes logging you’ll need to understand which logs you need, where to send them, and any limitations that may influence your decisions. for example, gke container logs are removed when their host pod is removed, if the log storage disk runs out of space, or when logs are periodically rotated. once exported to an external source such as stackdriver though, retention is only affected by the policy (if any) set on that platform and the events can be easily ingested into the siem.see the following tips to maximize your log coverage:gkekubernetes audit logging is integrated with cloud audit logs and stackdriver logging.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0admin activity log - contains api calls for administrative, state-changing actions on resources; enabled by default, no cost\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0data access log - contains api calls for read actions on resources and user-driven api calls on user-provided resource data; disabled by default, can be expensiveeksamazon eks integrates with cloudtrail to log eks api by calls by users, roles, or services as events. amazon eks control plane logs are delivered to cloudwatch. the control plane log streams include kubernetes api server component logs (api), audit (audit), authenticator (authenticator), controller manager (controllermanager), and scheduler (scheduler).once these logs are in place, they are ready to be ingested by your security analytics or log management platform.from here, you’d typically have to ask yourself how to monitor these logs. how does the log syntax for unauthenticated requests differ between cloudwatch and stackdriver? what interesting platform-specific api events might exist, such as association of aws iam with a kubernetes service account? fortunately, this part is already done for you in usm anywhere.we have released the following cloud kubernetes correlation rules that support both eks and gke, including:tags: cloud security, logging, kubernetes, containers, container securityinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",

cryptomining malware using a new memory loader based on ezuri and written in golang. since then, teamtnt has added another tool to their list of capabilities.the objective of the new tool is to hide the malicious process from process information programs such as `ps` and `lsof`, effectively acting as a defense evasion technique.the tool, named libprocesshider, is an open source tool from 2014 located on github, described as \"hide a process under linux using the ld preloader.\\'\\' preloading allows the system to load a custom shared library before other system libraries are loaded. if the custom shared library exports a function with the same signature of one located in the system libraries, the custom version will override it.the tool implements the function readdir() which is being used by processes such as `ps` to read the /proc directory to find running processes and to modify the return value in case there is a match between the processes found and the process needed to hide.the new tool arrives within a base64 encoded script hidden in the teamtnt cryptominer binary or ircbot (figure 1):figure 1. base64 encoded script, via alien labs analysis.upon binary execution, the bash script will run through a multitude of tasks. specifically, the script will:after decoding, we can observe the bash script functionality and how some malicious activity occurs before the shared library is created (figure 2):figure 2. decoded bash script, via alien labs analysis.the new tool is first dropped as a hidden tar file on disk, the script decompresses it, writes it to \\'/usr/local/lib/systemhealt.so\\', and then adds it preload via \\'/etc/ld.so.preload\\'. this will be used by the system to preload the file before other system libraries, allowing the attacker to override some common functions (figure 3/4).figure 3/4. bash script features, via alien labs analysis.the main purpose of the tool is to hide the teamtnt bot from process viewer tools, which use the file \\'/usr/bin/sbin\\' as you can see in figure 3 and 4 (setup_ircbot function).as final step, the malware will remove traces by deleting bash history:figure 5. bash script cleanup, via alien labs analysis.through the use of libprocesshider, teamtnt once again expands their capabilities based on the available open source tools. while the new functionality of libprocesshider is to evade detection and other basic functions, it acts as an indicator to consider when hunting for malicious activity on the host level. alien labs will continue to monitor the threat and report on any noteworthy activity.the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional

            "{'titel': 'malware using new ezuri memory loader', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was written by ofer caspi and fernando martinez of at&t alien labsmultiple threat actors have recently started using a go language (golang) tool to act as a packer and avoid antivirus detection. additionally, the ezuri memory loader tool acts as a malware loader and executes its payload in memory, without writing the file to disk. while this technique is known and commonly used by windows malware, it is less popular in linux environments. the loader decrypts the malicious malware and executes it using memfd create (as described in this blog in 2018). when creating a process, the system returns a file descriptor to an anonymous file in \\'/proc/pid/fd/\\' which is visible only in the filesystem.figure 1 shows a code snippet from the loader, containing the information it uses in order to decrypt the payload using the aes algorithm. figure 1. loader code snippet via alien labs analysis.the loader, written in golang, is taken from the \"ezuri\" code on github via the user guitmz. this user originally created the elf loader around march 2019, when he wrote a blog about the technique to run elf executables from memory and shared the loader on his github. additionally, a similar user ‘tmz’ (presumably associated with the previously mentioned ‘guitmz’) posted this same code in late august, on a small forum where malware samples are shared.the guitmz user even ran tests against virustotal to prove the efficiency of the code, uploading a detected linux.cephei sample (35308b8b770d2d4f78299262f595a0769e55152cb432d0efc42292db01609a18) with 30/61 av detections in virustotal, compared to the zero av detections by the same sample hidden with the ezuri code (ddbb714157f2ef91c1ec350cdf1d1f545290967f61491404c81b4e6e52f5c41f).the execution flow of the loader is to first decrypt the payload and then execute it from memory (figure 2):figure 2. execution flow, retrieved from alien labs analysis.guitmz gave this sample the name ezuri, probably after the card with the same name from the card game “magic: the gathering.” \\xa0this card has the capability to “regenerate another target elf,” reflecting the \\xa0malware’s capability of loading and executing an elf file in memory.at&t alien labs team accessed guitmz’s upload of code for analysis. the tool is written in golang and is intuitive to use. when executing, it first asks the path for the payload to be encrypted, along with the password to be used for aes encryption. if no password is given, the tool generates one, which is used to hide the malware within the loader. after the user\\'s input, the packer compiles the loader with the payload encrypted within it, so it can be decrypted and executed in memory once it is placed in the victim’s system. figure 4 shows the main function of the executable, where the file is first decrypted by “aesdec” to then be run in memory by “runfrommemory”. figure 3 shows ezuri main function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.figure 4 shows the “runfrommemory” function used to execute the payload in memory without placing the detectable malware on disk.figure 4 shows ezuri runfrommemory function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.to use the tool, the user will be requested to enter the file to be hidden, with a target process name as well as an optional aes key for encryption (figure 5):figure 5 shows ezuri execution, retrieved from alien labs analysis.at&t alien labs has identified several malware authors leveraging the ezuri loader in the last few months, including teamtnt, which was the first identified. teamtnt is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least april 2020, when the security firm trend micro first reported on them. the main focus of the group is to target docker systems with misconfigurations, as well as unprotected and exposed management apis, to later install ddos bots and cryptominers in the infected systems. a few months after the trend micro report, in august 2020, cado security found new developments in the teamtnt group. in october 2020, palo alto networks unit42 identified new variants of the cryptomining malware used by teamtnt named “black-t.” this sample first installs three network scanners, and then inspects memory in an attempt to retrieve any type of credentials located in the memory. additionally, unit42 identified several german-language strings in some of the tnt scripts.the last sample identified by palo alto networks unit42 is actually an ezuri loader. the decrypted payload is an elf file packed with upx, which is a known sample from teamtnt, first seen in june 2020 (e15550481e89dbd154b875ce50cc5af4b49f9ff7b837d9ac5b5594e5d63966a3).the techniques and code similarities between the original tool, named ezuri, and the one recently used by teamtnt are vast. the most evident one being the \\'ezuri\\' string in the compiled binary (figure 6):figure 6 shows ezuri string in teamtnt\\xa0sample retrieved from alien labs analysis.using this packer, the antivirus (av) detection drops dramatically. looking at the teamtnt malware detections before using ezuri packer (b494ca3b7bae2ab9a5197b81e928baae5b8eac77dfdc7fe1223fee8f27024772), we see 28/62 av detections of the malware, while the ezuri packed version (751014e0154d219dea8c2e999714c32fd98f817782588cd7af355d2488eb1c80) drops to only 3/64 av detections.in addition to teamtnt, there were several gafgyt samples observed (popular iot device malware with ddos attacks purposes). several malware authors have been using an open source golang tool to act as a malware loader, using a known technique to load the elf binaries into memory and avoid using easy-to-detect files on disk. the authors use the open source tool ezuri, to load its previously seen payloads and avoid antivirus detections on the file. the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe

            "{'titel': 'trickbot bazarloader in depth', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsofer caspi, a fellow alien labs researcher, co-authored this blog.at&t alien labs actively tracks the trickbot group through an automated malware analysis system, hunting, and in-depth technical research. on april 20th, 2020 independent security researchers “pancak3lullz” (@pancak3lullz) and vitali kremez (@vk_intel) posted a tweet regarding two new trickbot modules aptly named “bazarloader” and “bazarbackdoor” after attempted command and control (c2) communications with the emercoin dns (emerdns) .bazar domains. emerdns is desirable for attackers because it is a distributed blockchain that is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. alien labs’ automated malware analysis engine had picked up these samples a few days earlier (ex: 7c93d9175a38c23d44d76d9a883f7f3da1e244c2ab6c3ac9f29a9c9e20d20a5f)bleepingcomputer posted a blog with input from vitali kremez regarding a phishing campaign distributed through the sendgrid email marketing platform delivering covid-19 lures that ultimately led to the trickbot bazarbackdoor. the purpose of this blog is to provide additional technical details and an in-depth study of the signed trickbot bazarloader.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0since trickbot was discovered in 2016 it has been involved in information stealing, credential theft, ransomware, bitcoin mining, and loading other common crimeware malware as a first or second stage loader. for initial access as a first stage loader it typically accomplishes its objective through spear phishing links (t1192) or spear phishing attachments (t1193) using macro enabled microsoft office files. as a second stage payload and dynamic link library (dll) it is frequently loaded by emotet. to a lesser extent trickbot has been loaded by ostap javascript downloader and buer loader. in higher priority, higher profile trickbot anchor campaigns that target enterprises, powertrick and more_eggs/terraloader have been used to load other frameworks.trickbot has recently added a remote desktop protocol (rdp) brute force scanner module, an active directory (ad) harvesting module, and the mexec executor module. there are some indications that trickbot may be moving away from their mshare, mworm, and tabdll modules for retrieving payloads from urls in favor of the “nworm” module performing this task. it is important to note that trickbot group prefers to use shellcode “file-less” modules making detection more difficult.alien labs has previously identified digitally signed trickbot loaders, one of which was signed by an entity named “vb corporate pty. ltd.” pivoting in virustotal on the signer shows the first submission was on 2020-01-02 20:24:57. historically, the trickbot group has continued to reuse their revoked certificates to sign trickbot loaders as long as six months after the initial date of detection on virustotal. a list of known trickbot signers is included below. the associated signature serial numbers are included in the yara rule in the appendix.the trickbot bazarloader authors have produced an advanced module, with a significant amount of obfuscation. the bazarloader/cryptor uses multiple routines to hide api calls and embedded strings, which are then decrypted and resolved at runtime. once executed, the loader will allocate memory to store and decrypt its shellcode, which will be allocated to a numa node for faster execution. after allocation and decryption, the next instructions will jump to the shellcode that will be executed on the heap.next, the malware will try to communicate with .bazar domain c2 servers. once the c2 has been established, the loader will try to inject its payload into a system process using the process hollowing technique (t1093), which will create a suspended thread, unmap the destination image from memory, allocate new memory in the target process, copy the shellcode into the target process, set the thread context, and resume the process. in the sample analyzed, 1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83, the loader will first attempt to inject into an “svchost” process, and if injection fails, it will try to inject into the “explorer.exe” process, and if injection fails again as a last-ditch effort the loader will attempt to inject into the “cmd.exe” process. for persistence the loader will create a registry key under “hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\winlogon\\\\userinit”.the malware uses the windows api “virtualallocexnuma” function to allocate memory for its shellcode to be executed. the “virtualallocexnuma” function is used to allocate memory on a numa node, which allows for faster execution. the implementation can be seen in figure 1 below. it is interesting to note that the “virtualallocexnuma” function is not commonly used in process injection.figure 1. api resolution and shellcode decryption routinesin figure 1 above the bazarloader allocates memory using the uncommon “virtualallocexnuma” routine, and then it uses two iterations of the decryption routine to decrypt its shellcode. in the second call to the decrypt function some of the encryption key bytes are changed based on function parameters. in figure 2 below a representation of the decompiled decrypt routine can be seen importing the encryption key, modifying the encryption key bytes dependent on the parameters passed, and then decrypting the data.figure 2. decryption routinethe bazarloader authors have created dozens of decryption routines, and with almost each string including apis, dlls, and c2s there is a once per use unique decryption routine. an example of multiple decryption routines can be seen in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 below.figure 3. decryption routinefigure 4. decryption routinefigure 5. decryption routinethe loader uses the same decryption technique described above to resolve the api calls it uses during execution. the windows api resolution can be seen in figure 6 below.figure 6. windows api resolutionfor injection, the malware resolves apis from the ntdll.dll after it loads from disk and checks that there are no inline hooks within its function, that could be created for example by av software that tracks those api calls.the targeted processes for injection can be seen in figure 7 below.figure 7. targeted svchost, explorer, and cmd windows processes\\xa0the bazarloader injection code can be seen

            "{'titel': 'a hipaa compliance checklist', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsmaintaining security and compliance with hipaa, the health insurance portability and accountability act, is growing ever more challenging. the networks that house protected health information (phi or ephi) are becoming larger and more complex — especially as organizations move data to the cloud. at the same time, security professionals are faced with an evolving threat landscape of increasingly sophisticated threat actors and methods of attack.for example, 2018 threat intelligence research by at&t alien\\xa0labs reports a rise in the number of targeted ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. these attacks are often backed by organized criminals who see opportunities for making money from health care providers and other similar entities who must protect and keep assets, systems, and networks continuously operating.one such criminal group operating the samsam ransomware is thought to have earned more than $5 million dollars by manually compromising critical healthcare networks. and, according to alienvault labs, the methods used by samsam are more akin to a targeted attack than typical opportunistic ransomware.to help address these security challenges and ensure adherence to compliance mandates, security and it professionals should consider how people, processes, and technology can be used together to create a holistic it security compliance program that simplifies preparation, auditing and reporting, as well as ongoing security risk management and breach monitoring and response. here’s a five-step hipaa compliance checklist to get started.certification and ongoing hipaa compliancehipaa sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. any entity that deals with protected health information must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. in 2009, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act was adopted to promote the “meaningful use of health information technology” and address the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information. although there is no standard or implementation specification that requires a covered entity to “certify” compliance, the evaluation standard § 164.308(a)(8) requires covered entities to perform ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations that establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements. evaluations can be performed and documented internally or by an external organization that provides evaluation or “certification” services. however, hitech requires the hhs office for civil rights (ocr) to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the hipaa privacy, security, and breach notification rules.step 1: start with a comprehensive risk assessment and gap analysisyour compliance strategy should start with a solid foundation, which is why the first step in your journey to hipaa compliance should be a readiness assessment that includes a comprehensive risk and compliance analysis of your electronic health record (ehr) environment. this assessment is often best done by a third party with expertise in healthcare security and compliance, as hipaa regulations can be confusing and cumbersome. using a third party with the necessary expertise will ensure you don’t miss or misunderstand the required regulations, and it will save you time as they will likely have a hipaa checklist to reference.\\xa0your consultant can perform an initial evaluation of your entire security program to determine its adherence to hipaa regulations and the level of readiness to proceed with the “certification” process. it’s worth noting that the ocr does not actually “certify” hipaa compliance (see side bar), however there are organizations outside of the ocr that do provide “certification” services, and many organizations take advantage of these certification services to prove compliance. as a result of the evaluation, your consultant should provide a comprehensive report that may include such things as:according to the ocr, organizations that have aligned their security programs to the national institute for standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework may find it helpful as a starting place to identify potential gaps in their compliance with the hipaa security rule. addressing these gaps can bolster compliance with the security rule and improve the organization’s ability to secure ephi and other critical information and business processes. read how nist “maps” to the hipaa security rule in the hipaa security rule crosswalk to nist cybersecurity framework.step 2: remediate identified risks and address compliance gapsonce you’ve identified your organization’s risks, take immediate steps to address the gaps within your security program. again, a consultant who has practical experience in healthcare security will be very useful in providing strategic guidance, as well as advice on risk mitigation. many organizations use the same consultant who performed their initial risk assessment.your consultant may develop specific programs, policies, standards, and procedures, as well as support or help implement key security practices and controls. for example, they may assist in prioritizing vulnerabilities and make recommendations for remediation in your ehr environment. or, they may provide pre-packaged employee security awareness training that meets hipaa guidelines, such as educating employees on security risks and running them through attack scenarios.make use of security technology to help you more quickly address the gaps in your compliance program — and consider platforms versus point solutions, giving you the ability to address multiple issues at once. also, look for solutions that address both on-premises and multi-cloud environments as hipaa regulations apply to both (see guidance on hipaa & cloud computing).\\xa0for example, look for such use cases as the automation of asset discovery and the ability to categorize those assets into hipaa groups for easy management and reporting. those same solutions may also perform vulnerability assessments, automate the prioritization of vulnerabilities for mitigation, and integrate with ticketing solutions to ensure the most critical are being remediated while overall risks are mitigated.step 3: take advantage of automated compliance reportingthe evaluation standard of hipaa requires covered entities to perform and document ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations to establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements.most solutions do not cover all the requirements defined by the hipaa audit protocol, but they will give you a jump on your hipaa checklist.many security management platforms also include additional predefined event reports, such as reports by data source and data source type, helping to make daily compliance monitoring and reporting activities more efficient.also, look for an intuitive and flexible interface that allows you to quickly search and analyze your security data, as well as the ability to create and save custom views and export them as executive-ready reports.finally, solutions that provide centralized visibility of your cloud and on-premises assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and log data from firewalls and other security tools are key to giving you the most complete and contextual data set for maintaining and documenting continuous compliance.step 4: implement monitoring and breach notification protocolsthe breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and business associates to provide notifications if they experience a breach that involves unsecured protected health information.security management platforms can help to simplify and automate monitoring for breaches on your network, ensuring you are able to more quickly detect and contain a breach, as well as provide the required notifications.as more organizations in healthcare are migrating data and applications to the cloud, make sure the technology you’re choosing offers advanced threat detection across both on-premises and multi-cloud environments. simplify compliance management by choosing a solution that combines an array of essential security capabilities in one platform. these may include, but are not limited to: asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, endpoint detection and response, siem event correlation, file integrity monitoring (fim), and log management. by combining these use cases in a single dashboard, you are better able to quickly identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats that target your ehr environment.intelligence it key to threat detection and incident response, so consider vendors who have in-house research teams as well as access to external threat intelligence communities and other sources that can provide insight into the latest global threats and vulnerabilities — and in particular, those that are specific to healthcare.however, intelligence without context will create lot of distracting “noise” for your team. so, check that the solution goes beyond just providing intelligence to incorporating it directly into your dashboard, including providing recommendations on how to respond to identified threats. with this intelligence and guidance at your fingertips, you can react quickly to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. and, you are assured of an always-up-to-date and optimally performing security monitoring solution.need more info on how to respond to a breach? see the hhs quick response checklist.step 5: continuously evaluate and manage riskwhether you are managing ongoing hipaa compliance internally or are using an external organization, avoid last-minute scrambling for annual evaluations and audits by employing a year-round risk management program. such a program requires having real-time visibility of your environment, including system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall information, and product upgrades.use a unified platform to gain this visibility and enable monitoring in a central location (opposed to various point solutions). here are a few examples of where a platform would be helpful for continuous risk and compliance management:examples: use automated asset discovery for on-premises and cloud environments and then create asset groups such as business critical assets or hipaa assets for ongoing monitoring, management and reporting. identify systems with known vulnerabilities and use correlation rules to detect threats.examples: monitor for successful and failed logon events to assets. monitor for communications with known malicious ip addresses or use file integrity monitoring (fim) to detect, assess and

            "{'titel': 'slack phishing attacks using webhooks', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsslack is a cloud-based messaging platform that is commonly used in workplace communications. it is feature-rich, offering additional functionality such as video calling and screen sharing in addition to a marketplace containing thousands of third-party applications and add-ons.slack incoming webhooks allow you to post messages from your applications to slack. by specifying a unique url, your message body, and a destination channel, you can send a message to any webhook that you know the url for in any workspace, regardless of membership. webhooks take the format of https://hooks.slack.com/services/t00000000/b00000000/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.generally, slack webhooks are considered a low risk integration due to the following assumptions:a deeper dive into webhooks shows that this is not entirely accurate.first, a channel override allows you to override the previously specified webhook target channel by adding the “channel” key to your json payload. if you gain access to a webhook for one channel, you can use it in others. considering sending to #general, #engineering, and other default or common channels to target a wider audience.in some cases, this can also override channel posting permissions (such as admin-only posting).slack documentation suggests that allowed target channels are based on the original creator of the webhook: “posting_to_general_channel_denied is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the \"#general\" channel for a workspace where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. you\\'ll receive this error with a http 403.” so if you can find a webhook created by an admin - congrats, you can post to admin channels!a quick search on github shows 130,989 public code results containing slack webhook urls, with a majority containing the full unique webhook value.the last assumption is true - webhooks can only accept data. that’s where we get creative.the process itself is fairly simple:as mentioned earlier, github is a good start for scraping publicly committed webhook data.first, create an app. you will also need a web server to handle the oauth flow.slack apps don’t require oauth, but in this case we will be using the slack api to access data in workspaces where the malicious app is installed. when the user attempts to install the application, they must approve the requested oauth scopes. their approval is sent to the oauth client, which retrieves an access token from the authorization server. this access token may be used to retrieve data using the specified service scopes until authorization is revoked. read more about using oauth 2.0 here.you will also need to set your oauth scope(s) to whatever data you want to exfiltrate from slack. in my case, i chose files:read in order to access files on the victim\\'s workspace.your redirect url must be set to the oauth client url.the following code snippet can be used to handle the oauth 2.0 handshake using python and flask.the following payload will send a message to the #general channel associated with the unique webhook url. in this scenario, we’re claiming that the webhook configuration needs to be updated.payload:message:the link points to https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?scope=files:read&client_id=834500968371.846020497941, which is actually the shareable url for my malicious slack app.upon clicking, the user will be directed to install “webhook configuration”.at no point is it clear that the victim has interacted with any domain except for slack.com.after exchanging the temporary authorization code for the access token, you will receive a response from slack containing the access token in addition to some other data, including identifiers for the user, team, and enterprise they are part of.distribution statistics can also be tracked from your app’s distribution page at https://api.slack.com/apps/.once you receive the user’s access token, you are free to access data on their behalf. note that slack has mostly moved to using perspectival scopes, i.e. user tokens or bot tokens that give access within the context of that entity. what you can access depends on the requester access and the scopes that your app initially requested. in my example, files:read was used.the above request allows us to list all files that the user has access to, and subsequently download each of them using the access token and the private url returned by the files.list method.the example in this post shows a simple phishing and data exfiltration flow. in theory, this could also be used for propagation of attacks across users and workspaces.the chat.postmessage method allows you to send messages via channel or direct message. with the chat:write:user permission, messages can be sent as_user using the context of the user token. compromising one member of your workspace would allow more targeted or convincing malicious messages to be sent to channels they are part of or directly to their peers, similar to the high-profile gsuite phishing attack in 2018 which was also covered by us in a previous blog post.users of shared channels can direct message users participating in the shared channels across workspaces. targeting those users would allow for compromise across multiple workspaces.application whitelistingadministrators have the option to manage their users’ slack applications. in less sensitive workspaces, this may involve only allowing apps from the app directory. applications added to the directory are required to go through slack’s own app security review process prior to approval.more sensitive environments may call for application whitelisting/application approval, requiring an administrator to review and approve applications before installation. this option is strongly recommended for companies looking to comply with ccpa, gdpr, and other regulations that require tracking of sharing of personal data with third parties.detection of suspicious oauth applicationsif whitelisting is not an option or you’d like an extra layer of defense, you may be interested in detecting suspicious slack oauth applications that users are adding to your workspace. by ingesting slack audit log data into a security analytics platform such as usm anywhere, one can alert on these suspicious actions.for example, some items of interest might include:see more on the event actions that can be monitored in slack’s official documentation.some mitigations could only be implemented by slack.implement least privilege for incoming webhookswebhooks should default to only working in the defined channel. multi-channel webhooks/overrides should be a separate application or opt-in setting. since the override feature is nested under a “setup instructions” pane that requires user interaction to display, many users are not aware of it. webhooks should not be able to post to announcement-only/admin-only channels unless that channel is explicitly defined in the webhook configuration.improved awareness of secrets handlingnone of the text on the incoming webhook configuration page asserts the importance of secure storage of the webhook url. this issue paired with the hidden “features” of incoming webhooks may lead to users assuming low-to-no risk associated with webhooks, as is supported by the frequency of webhooks publicly committed.application verificationapps that have not been reviewed by slack and are not local to the workspace should have limited functionality or require further verification. consider a process similar to the google oauth verification process, where unverified apps using high-risk scopes require additional developer identity verification and/or are capped to a certain number of users to avoid widespread abuse.webhooks are credential tools that provide access to posting functionality within a workspace.\\xa0though data cannot be exposed through webhooks on slack, we do recommend that workspace owners or admins invalidate publicly exposed webhook urls and generate new ones. to help slack admins with that diligence, we\\xa0proactively scrape github for publicly exposed webhooks and invalidate them. webhooks are safe as long as they remain secret since the webhook url itself is unguessable.\\xa0we also recommend workspace owners and admins use\\xa0these best practices\\xa0for storing credentials safely and that they review\\xa0this guide\\xa0to sending messages using incoming webhooks.we also provide additional features to support the proper oversight of app installation and usage within workspaces, which help workspace owners and admins protect their workspaces. we allow teams to require admin approvals on all apps, and recommend they establish and follow basic security diligence procedures before permitting apps to be added into a workspace. our security recommendations for approving apps can be found\\xa0here.tags: phishing, slack, webhooksinsights reportat&t cybersecurity

            "{'titel': 'security monitoring for managed cloud kubernetes', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsphoto by\\xa0chuttersnap\\xa0on\\xa0unsplashkubernetes (k8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. it has recently seen rapid adoption across enterprise environments.many environments rely on managed kubernetes services such as google kubernetes engine (gke) and amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) to take advantage of the benefits of both containerization and the cloud. google cloud platform, for example, offers advanced cluster management features such as automatic upgrades, load balancing, and stackdriver logging. amazon web services (aws) provides kubernetes(r) role based access control (rbac) integration with aws iam authenticator and logging via cloudtrail and cloudwatch.however, adoption of these cloud-managed services can introduce new challenges to your monitoring and detection capabilities, such as:the purpose of this post and associated release is to help fill in the detection gaps between kubernetes, eks, and gke, and provide normalized detection strategies that include multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.with their advanced features, cloud-managed services add potential and new attack vectors as well as room for error or confusion.kubernetes itself is highly complex; trail of bits recently published a security assessment of the kubernetes platform. the intent of the audit was to identify and document existing risks and vulnerabilities of the platform, ultimately providing recommendations to improve its security posture.the assessment team found configuration and deployment of kubernetes to be non-trivial, with certain components having “confusing default settings, missing operational controls, and implicitly defined security controls”. this presents a need to understand the vulnerabilities and limitations of the platform itself, in addition to passing a high technical barrier of entry.each managed cloud service may remediate these issues differently (or not at all). according to google, “the report also calls out kubernetes’ default settings. in gke, we’ve been actively changing these over time, including turning off abac and basic authentication by default, to make sure new clusters you create are more secure.”\\xa0 abac is attribute-based access control.insecure defaults may have inconsistent fixes between managed platforms, and new protections may not apply to earlier versions. a well-intentioned administrator may also re-enable insecure settings to restore previous functionality or compatibility.because of this, our new detections are focused not only on potential attacks but on environmental awareness with an emphasis on multi-cloud support.managed services such as amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) and google kubernetes engine (gke) use a shared responsibility model which describe the role of security of the cloud and security in the cloud (see: the gke shared responsibility model versus eks).the good news is that this model clearly defines things that aren’t your responsibility - like the underlying infrastructure, the etcd database, and control plane nodes. the bad news is that you also need to understand what you are responsible for in order to implement the proper security monitoring and controls, and this includes platform-specific implementations such as defining and protecting your security groups or iam roles.api server flags, security control defaults, and the kubernetes patch version may also be considered in their purview for new systems, while any modifications to that or continued use of legacy systems become yours. through correlation rules you are able to better track these security regressions.logs are the foundation of security monitoring and the key to understanding who is doing what on your systems. usm anywhere supports log collection for aws, gcp, and azure, which significantly expedites the collection and normalization of log data.in addition to the kubernetes control plane logs, you should also remember to monitor the associated api logs for the cloud services such as api calls to eks or gke.for cloud-managed kubernetes logging you’ll need to understand which logs you need, where to send them, and any limitations that may influence your decisions. for example, gke container logs are removed when their host pod is removed, if the log storage disk runs out of space, or when logs are periodically rotated. once exported to an external source such as stackdriver though, retention is only affected by the policy (if any) set on that platform and the events can be easily ingested into the siem.see the following tips to maximize your log coverage:gkekubernetes audit logging is integrated with cloud audit logs and stackdriver logging.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0admin activity log - contains api calls for administrative, state-changing actions on resources; enabled by default, no cost\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0data access log - contains api calls for read actions on resources and user-driven api calls on user-provided resource data; disabled by default, can be expensiveeksamazon eks integrates with cloudtrail to log eks api by calls by users, roles, or services as events. amazon eks control plane logs are delivered to cloudwatch. the control plane log streams include kubernetes api server component logs (api), audit (audit), authenticator (authenticator), controller manager (controllermanager), and scheduler (scheduler).once these logs are in place, they are ready to be ingested by your security analytics or log management platform.from here, you’d typically have to ask yourself how to monitor these logs. how does the log syntax for unauthenticated requests differ between cloudwatch and stackdriver? what interesting platform-specific api events might exist, such as association of aws iam with a kubernetes service account? fortunately, this part is already done for you in usm anywhere.we have released the following cloud kubernetes correlation rules that support both eks and gke, including:tags: cloud security, logging, kubernetes, containers, container securityinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",

            "{'titel': 'malware using new ezuri memory loader', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was written by ofer caspi and fernando martinez of at&t alien labsmultiple threat actors have recently started using a go language (golang) tool to act as a packer and avoid antivirus detection. additionally, the ezuri memory loader tool acts as a malware loader and executes its payload in memory, without writing the file to disk. while this technique is known and commonly used by windows malware, it is less popular in linux environments. the loader decrypts the malicious malware and executes it using memfd create (as described in this blog in 2018). when creating a process, the system returns a file descriptor to an anonymous file in \\'/proc/pid/fd/\\' which is visible only in the filesystem.figure 1 shows a code snippet from the loader, containing the information it uses in order to decrypt the payload using the aes algorithm. figure 1. loader code snippet via alien labs analysis.the loader, written in golang, is taken from the \"ezuri\" code on github via the user guitmz. this user originally created the elf loader around march 2019, when he wrote a blog about the technique to run elf executables from memory and shared the loader on his github. additionally, a similar user ‘tmz’ (presumably associated with the previously mentioned ‘guitmz’) posted this same code in late august, on a small forum where malware samples are shared.the guitmz user even ran tests against virustotal to prove the efficiency of the code, uploading a detected linux.cephei sample (35308b8b770d2d4f78299262f595a0769e55152cb432d0efc42292db01609a18) with 30/61 av detections in virustotal, compared to the zero av detections by the same sample hidden with the ezuri code (ddbb714157f2ef91c1ec350cdf1d1f545290967f61491404c81b4e6e52f5c41f).the execution flow of the loader is to first decrypt the payload and then execute it from memory (figure 2):figure 2. execution flow, retrieved from alien labs analysis.guitmz gave this sample the name ezuri, probably after the card with the same name from the card game “magic: the gathering.” \\xa0this card has the capability to “regenerate another target elf,” reflecting the \\xa0malware’s capability of loading and executing an elf file in memory.at&t alien labs team accessed guitmz’s upload of code for analysis. the tool is written in golang and is intuitive to use. when executing, it first asks the path for the payload to be encrypted, along with the password to be used for aes encryption. if no password is given, the tool generates one, which is used to hide the malware within the loader. after the user\\'s input, the packer compiles the loader with the payload encrypted within it, so it can be decrypted and executed in memory once it is placed in the victim’s system. figure 4 shows the main function of the executable, where the file is first decrypted by “aesdec” to then be run in memory by “runfrommemory”. figure 3 shows ezuri main function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.figure 4 shows the “runfrommemory” function used to execute the payload in memory without placing the detectable malware on disk.figure 4 shows ezuri runfrommemory function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.to use the tool, the user will be requested to enter the file to be hidden, with a target process name as well as an optional aes key for encryption (figure 5):figure 5 shows ezuri execution, retrieved from alien labs analysis.at&t alien labs has identified several malware authors leveraging the ezuri loader in the last few months, including teamtnt, which was the first identified. teamtnt is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least april 2020, when the security firm trend micro first reported on them. the main focus of the group is to target docker systems with misconfigurations, as well as unprotected and exposed management apis, to later install ddos bots and cryptominers in the infected systems. a few months after the trend micro report, in august 2020, cado security found new developments in the teamtnt group. in october 2020, palo alto networks unit42 identified new variants of the cryptomining malware used by teamtnt named “black-t.” this sample first installs three network scanners, and then inspects memory in an attempt to retrieve any type of credentials located in the memory. additionally, unit42 identified several german-language strings in some of the tnt scripts.the last sample identified by palo alto networks unit42 is actually an ezuri loader. the decrypted payload is an elf file packed with upx, which is a known sample from teamtnt, first seen in june 2020 (e15550481e89dbd154b875ce50cc5af4b49f9ff7b837d9ac5b5594e5d63966a3).the techniques and code similarities between the original tool, named ezuri, and the one recently used by teamtnt are vast. the most evident one being the \\'ezuri\\' string in the compiled binary (figure 6):figure 6 shows ezuri string in teamtnt\\xa0sample retrieved from alien labs analysis.using this packer, the antivirus (av) detection drops dramatically. looking at the teamtnt malware detections before using ezuri packer (b494ca3b7bae2ab9a5197b81e928baae5b8eac77dfdc7fe1223fee8f27024772), we see 28/62 av detections of the malware, while the ezuri packed version (751014e0154d219dea8c2e999714c32fd98f817782588cd7af355d2488eb1c80) drops to only 3/64 av detections.in addition to teamtnt, there were several gafgyt samples observed (popular iot device malware with ddos attacks purposes). several malware authors have been using an open source golang tool to act as a malware loader, using a known technique to load the elf binaries into memory and avoid using easy-to-detect files on disk. the authors use the open source tool ezuri, to load its previously seen payloads and avoid antivirus detections on the file. the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe

            "{'titel': 'trickbot bazarloader in depth', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsofer caspi, a fellow alien labs researcher, co-authored this blog.at&t alien labs actively tracks the trickbot group through an automated malware analysis system, hunting, and in-depth technical research. on april 20th, 2020 independent security researchers “pancak3lullz” (@pancak3lullz) and vitali kremez (@vk_intel) posted a tweet regarding two new trickbot modules aptly named “bazarloader” and “bazarbackdoor” after attempted command and control (c2) communications with the emercoin dns (emerdns) .bazar domains. emerdns is desirable for attackers because it is a distributed blockchain that is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. alien labs’ automated malware analysis engine had picked up these samples a few days earlier (ex: 7c93d9175a38c23d44d76d9a883f7f3da1e244c2ab6c3ac9f29a9c9e20d20a5f)bleepingcomputer posted a blog with input from vitali kremez regarding a phishing campaign distributed through the sendgrid email marketing platform delivering covid-19 lures that ultimately led to the trickbot bazarbackdoor. the purpose of this blog is to provide additional technical details and an in-depth study of the signed trickbot bazarloader.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0since trickbot was discovered in 2016 it has been involved in information stealing, credential theft, ransomware, bitcoin mining, and loading other common crimeware malware as a first or second stage loader. for initial access as a first stage loader it typically accomplishes its objective through spear phishing links (t1192) or spear phishing attachments (t1193) using macro enabled microsoft office files. as a second stage payload and dynamic link library (dll) it is frequently loaded by emotet. to a lesser extent trickbot has been loaded by ostap javascript downloader and buer loader. in higher priority, higher profile trickbot anchor campaigns that target enterprises, powertrick and more_eggs/terraloader have been used to load other frameworks.trickbot has recently added a remote desktop protocol (rdp) brute force scanner module, an active directory (ad) harvesting module, and the mexec executor module. there are some indications that trickbot may be moving away from their mshare, mworm, and tabdll modules for retrieving payloads from urls in favor of the “nworm” module performing this task. it is important to note that trickbot group prefers to use shellcode “file-less” modules making detection more difficult.alien labs has previously identified digitally signed trickbot loaders, one of which was signed by an entity named “vb corporate pty. ltd.” pivoting in virustotal on the signer shows the first submission was on 2020-01-02 20:24:57. historically, the trickbot group has continued to reuse their revoked certificates to sign trickbot loaders as long as six months after the initial date of detection on virustotal. a list of known trickbot signers is included below. the associated signature serial numbers are included in the yara rule in the appendix.the trickbot bazarloader authors have produced an advanced module, with a significant amount of obfuscation. the bazarloader/cryptor uses multiple routines to hide api calls and embedded strings, which are then decrypted and resolved at runtime. once executed, the loader will allocate memory to store and decrypt its shellcode, which will be allocated to a numa node for faster execution. after allocation and decryption, the next instructions will jump to the shellcode that will be executed on the heap.next, the malware will try to communicate with .bazar domain c2 servers. once the c2 has been established, the loader will try to inject its payload into a system process using the process hollowing technique (t1093), which will create a suspended thread, unmap the destination image from memory, allocate new memory in the target process, copy the shellcode into the target process, set the thread context, and resume the process. in the sample analyzed, 1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83, the loader will first attempt to inject into an “svchost” process, and if injection fails, it will try to inject into the “explorer.exe” process, and if injection fails again as a last-ditch effort the loader will attempt to inject into the “cmd.exe” process. for persistence the loader will create a registry key under “hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\winlogon\\\\userinit”.the malware uses the windows api “virtualallocexnuma” function to allocate memory for its shellcode to be executed. the “virtualallocexnuma” function is used to allocate memory on a numa node, which allows for faster execution. the implementation can be seen in figure 1 below. it is interesting to note that the “virtualallocexnuma” function is not commonly used in process injection.figure 1. api resolution and shellcode decryption routinesin figure 1 above the bazarloader allocates memory using the uncommon “virtualallocexnuma” routine, and then it uses two iterations of the decryption routine to decrypt its shellcode. in the second call to the decrypt function some of the encryption key bytes are changed based on function parameters. in figure 2 below a representation of the decompiled decrypt routine can be seen importing the encryption key, modifying the encryption key bytes dependent on the parameters passed, and then decrypting the data.figure 2. decryption routinethe bazarloader authors have created dozens of decryption routines, and with almost each string including apis, dlls, and c2s there is a once per use unique decryption routine. an example of multiple decryption routines can be seen in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 below.figure 3. decryption routinefigure 4. decryption routinefigure 5. decryption routinethe loader uses the same decryption technique described above to resolve the api calls it uses during execution. the windows api resolution can be seen in figure 6 below.figure 6. windows api resolutionfor injection, the malware resolves apis from the ntdll.dll after it loads from disk and checks that there are no inline hooks within its function, that could be created for example by av software that tracks those api calls.the targeted processes for injection can be seen in figure 7 below.figure 7. targeted svchost, explorer, and cmd windows processes\\xa0the bazarloader injection code can be seen

            "{'titel': 'a hipaa compliance checklist', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsmaintaining security and compliance with hipaa, the health insurance portability and accountability act, is growing ever more challenging. the networks that house protected health information (phi or ephi) are becoming larger and more complex — especially as organizations move data to the cloud. at the same time, security professionals are faced with an evolving threat landscape of increasingly sophisticated threat actors and methods of attack.for example, 2018 threat intelligence research by at&t alien\\xa0labs reports a rise in the number of targeted ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. these attacks are often backed by organized criminals who see opportunities for making money from health care providers and other similar entities who must protect and keep assets, systems, and networks continuously operating.one such criminal group operating the samsam ransomware is thought to have earned more than $5 million dollars by manually compromising critical healthcare networks. and, according to alienvault labs, the methods used by samsam are more akin to a targeted attack than typical opportunistic ransomware.to help address these security challenges and ensure adherence to compliance mandates, security and it professionals should consider how people, processes, and technology can be used together to create a holistic it security compliance program that simplifies preparation, auditing and reporting, as well as ongoing security risk management and breach monitoring and response. here’s a five-step hipaa compliance checklist to get started.certification and ongoing hipaa compliancehipaa sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. any entity that deals with protected health information must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. in 2009, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act was adopted to promote the “meaningful use of health information technology” and address the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information. although there is no standard or implementation specification that requires a covered entity to “certify” compliance, the evaluation standard § 164.308(a)(8) requires covered entities to perform ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations that establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements. evaluations can be performed and documented internally or by an external organization that provides evaluation or “certification” services. however, hitech requires the hhs office for civil rights (ocr) to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the hipaa privacy, security, and breach notification rules.step 1: start with a comprehensive risk assessment and gap analysisyour compliance strategy should start with a solid foundation, which is why the first step in your journey to hipaa compliance should be a readiness assessment that includes a comprehensive risk and compliance analysis of your electronic health record (ehr) environment. this assessment is often best done by a third party with expertise in healthcare security and compliance, as hipaa regulations can be confusing and cumbersome. using a third party with the necessary expertise will ensure you don’t miss or misunderstand the required regulations, and it will save you time as they will likely have a hipaa checklist to reference.\\xa0your consultant can perform an initial evaluation of your entire security program to determine its adherence to hipaa regulations and the level of readiness to proceed with the “certification” process. it’s worth noting that the ocr does not actually “certify” hipaa compliance (see side bar), however there are organizations outside of the ocr that do provide “certification” services, and many organizations take advantage of these certification services to prove compliance. as a result of the evaluation, your consultant should provide a comprehensive report that may include such things as:according to the ocr, organizations that have aligned their security programs to the national institute for standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework may find it helpful as a starting place to identify potential gaps in their compliance with the hipaa security rule. addressing these gaps can bolster compliance with the security rule and improve the organization’s ability to secure ephi and other critical information and business processes. read how nist “maps” to the hipaa security rule in the hipaa security rule crosswalk to nist cybersecurity framework.step 2: remediate identified risks and address compliance gapsonce you’ve identified your organization’s risks, take immediate steps to address the gaps within your security program. again, a consultant who has practical experience in healthcare security will be very useful in providing strategic guidance, as well as advice on risk mitigation. many organizations use the same consultant who performed their initial risk assessment.your consultant may develop specific programs, policies, standards, and procedures, as well as support or help implement key security practices and controls. for example, they may assist in prioritizing vulnerabilities and make recommendations for remediation in your ehr environment. or, they may provide pre-packaged employee security awareness training that meets hipaa guidelines, such as educating employees on security risks and running them through attack scenarios.make use of security technology to help you more quickly address the gaps in your compliance program — and consider platforms versus point solutions, giving you the ability to address multiple issues at once. also, look for solutions that address both on-premises and multi-cloud environments as hipaa regulations apply to both (see guidance on hipaa & cloud computing).\\xa0for example, look for such use cases as the automation of asset discovery and the ability to categorize those assets into hipaa groups for easy management and reporting. those same solutions may also perform vulnerability assessments, automate the prioritization of vulnerabilities for mitigation, and integrate with ticketing solutions to ensure the most critical are being remediated while overall risks are mitigated.step 3: take advantage of automated compliance reportingthe evaluation standard of hipaa requires covered entities to perform and document ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations to establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements.most solutions do not cover all the requirements defined by the hipaa audit protocol, but they will give you a jump on your hipaa checklist.many security management platforms also include additional predefined event reports, such as reports by data source and data source type, helping to make daily compliance monitoring and reporting activities more efficient.also, look for an intuitive and flexible interface that allows you to quickly search and analyze your security data, as well as the ability to create and save custom views and export them as executive-ready reports.finally, solutions that provide centralized visibility of your cloud and on-premises assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and log data from firewalls and other security tools are key to giving you the most complete and contextual data set for maintaining and documenting continuous compliance.step 4: implement monitoring and breach notification protocolsthe breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and business associates to provide notifications if they experience a breach that involves unsecured protected health information.security management platforms can help to simplify and automate monitoring for breaches on your network, ensuring you are able to more quickly detect and contain a breach, as well as provide the required notifications.as more organizations in healthcare are migrating data and applications to the cloud, make sure the technology you’re choosing offers advanced threat detection across both on-premises and multi-cloud environments. simplify compliance management by choosing a solution that combines an array of essential security capabilities in one platform. these may include, but are not limited to: asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, endpoint detection and response, siem event correlation, file integrity monitoring (fim), and log management. by combining these use cases in a single dashboard, you are better able to quickly identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats that target your ehr environment.intelligence it key to threat detection and incident response, so consider vendors who have in-house research teams as well as access to external threat intelligence communities and other sources that can provide insight into the latest global threats and vulnerabilities — and in particular, those that are specific to healthcare.however, intelligence without context will create lot of distracting “noise” for your team. so, check that the solution goes beyond just providing intelligence to incorporating it directly into your dashboard, including providing recommendations on how to respond to identified threats. with this intelligence and guidance at your fingertips, you can react quickly to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. and, you are assured of an always-up-to-date and optimally performing security monitoring solution.need more info on how to respond to a breach? see the hhs quick response checklist.step 5: continuously evaluate and manage riskwhether you are managing ongoing hipaa compliance internally or are using an external organization, avoid last-minute scrambling for annual evaluations and audits by employing a year-round risk management program. such a program requires having real-time visibility of your environment, including system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall information, and product upgrades.use a unified platform to gain this visibility and enable monitoring in a central location (opposed to various point solutions). here are a few examples of where a platform would be helpful for continuous risk and compliance management:examples: use automated asset discovery for on-premises and cloud environments and then create asset groups such as business critical assets or hipaa assets for ongoing monitoring, management and reporting. identify systems with known vulnerabilities and use correlation rules to detect threats.examples: monitor for successful and failed logon events to assets. monitor for communications with known malicious ip addresses or use file integrity monitoring (fim) to detect, assess and report on changes to system binaries, and content locations. schedule vulnerability scans, automate assessments, and plan for mitigation. review events and detected incidents.examples: aggregate events from across on-premises and multi-cloud environments. classify threats based on their risk level. monitor for stolen credentials, malware-based compromises such as communication to a known command and control (c&c) server, anomalous user and admin activities, file integrity, and vulnerabilities.example: automate forensics tasks to be executed in response to a detected threat and simplify forensics investigations with filters, search and reporting capabilities for event and log data. automate actions to contain threats, such as isolating systems from the network.use out-of-the box reporting to document that you’ve made an accurate assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic phi — and to quickly show the status of technical controls that align to hipaa or other regulations.maintaining adherence to hipaa is no small feat considering the dozens of criteria that are considered in the hipaa audit checklist. attempting to manage your compliance program manually and without the help of expert healthcare security consultants will not only take up massive amounts of time, it could result in your team missing an essential component of the regulation, or worse yet, enduring a breach that compromises patient data or takes down the network. however, with the right mix of people, processes and technology, it’s not an impossible to stay on top of compliance management while ensuring your network is secure and patient data protected year-round.hipaa regulationshipaa privacy rule: this rule set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by three types of covered entities: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and health care providers who conduct the standard healthcare transactions electronically.\\xa0hipaa security rule: this rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. the privacy rule is located at 45 cfr part 160 and subparts a and e of part 164\\xa0(e-phi).hipaa breach and notification rule: the hipaa breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information.tags: ransomware, risk management,

            "{'titel': 'slack phishing attacks using webhooks', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsslack is a cloud-based messaging platform that is commonly used in workplace communications. it is feature-rich, offering additional functionality such as video calling and screen sharing in addition to a marketplace containing thousands of third-party applications and add-ons.slack incoming webhooks allow you to post messages from your applications to slack. by specifying a unique url, your message body, and a destination channel, you can send a message to any webhook that you know the url for in any workspace, regardless of membership. webhooks take the format of https://hooks.slack.com/services/t00000000/b00000000/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.generally, slack webhooks are considered a low risk integration due to the following assumptions:a deeper dive into webhooks shows that this is not entirely accurate.first, a channel override allows you to override the previously specified webhook target channel by adding the “channel” key to your json payload. if you gain access to a webhook for one channel, you can use it in others. considering sending to #general, #engineering, and other default or common channels to target a wider audience.in some cases, this can also override channel posting permissions (such as admin-only posting).slack documentation suggests that allowed target channels are based on the original creator of the webhook: “posting_to_general_channel_denied is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the \"#general\" channel for a workspace where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. you\\'ll receive this error with a http 403.” so if you can find a webhook created by an admin - congrats, you can post to admin channels!a quick search on github shows 130,989 public code results containing slack webhook urls, with a majority containing the full unique webhook value.the last assumption is true - webhooks can only accept data. that’s where we get creative.the process itself is fairly simple:as mentioned earlier, github is a good start for scraping publicly committed webhook data.first, create an app. you will also need a web server to handle the oauth flow.slack apps don’t require oauth, but in this case we will be using the slack api to access data in workspaces where the malicious app is installed. when the user attempts to install the application, they must approve the requested oauth scopes. their approval is sent to the oauth client, which retrieves an access token from the authorization server. this access token may be used to retrieve data using the specified service scopes until authorization is revoked. read more about using oauth 2.0 here.you will also need to set your oauth scope(s) to whatever data you want to exfiltrate from slack. in my case, i chose files:read in order to access files on the victim\\'s workspace.your redirect url must be set to the oauth client url.the following code snippet can be used to handle the oauth 2.0 handshake using python and flask.the following payload will send a message to the #general channel associated with the unique webhook url. in this scenario, we’re claiming that the webhook configuration needs to be updated.payload:message:the link points to https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?scope=files:read&client_id=834500968371.846020497941, which is actually the shareable url for my malicious slack app.upon clicking, the user will be directed to install “webhook configuration”.at no point is it clear that the victim has interacted with any domain except for slack.com.after exchanging the temporary authorization code for the access token, you will receive a response from slack containing the access token in addition to some other data, including identifiers for the user, team, and enterprise they are part of.distribution statistics can also be tracked from your app’s distribution page at https://api.slack.com/apps/.once you receive the user’s access token, you are free to access data on their behalf. note that slack has mostly moved to using perspectival scopes, i.e. user tokens or bot tokens that give access within the context of that entity. what you can access depends on the requester access and the scopes that your app initially requested. in my example, files:read was used.the above request allows us to list all files that the user has access to, and subsequently download each of them using the access token and the private url returned by the files.list method.the example in this post shows a simple phishing and data exfiltration flow. in theory, this could also be used for propagation of attacks across users and workspaces.the chat.postmessage method allows you to send messages via channel or direct message. with the chat:write:user permission, messages can be sent as_user using the context of the user token. compromising one member of your workspace would allow more targeted or convincing malicious messages to be sent to channels they are part of or directly to their peers, similar to the high-profile gsuite phishing attack in 2018 which was also covered by us in a previous blog post.users of shared channels can direct message users participating in the shared channels across workspaces. targeting those users would allow for compromise across multiple workspaces.application whitelistingadministrators have the option to manage their users’ slack applications. in less sensitive workspaces, this may involve only allowing apps from the app directory. applications added to the directory are required to go through slack’s own app security review process prior to approval.more sensitive environments may call for application whitelisting/application approval, requiring an administrator to review and approve applications before installation. this option is strongly recommended for companies looking to comply with ccpa, gdpr, and other regulations that require tracking of sharing of personal data with third parties.detection of suspicious oauth applicationsif whitelisting is not an option or you’d like an extra layer of defense, you may be interested in detecting suspicious slack oauth applications that users are adding to your workspace. by ingesting slack audit log data into a security analytics platform such as usm anywhere, one can alert on these suspicious actions.for example, some items of interest might include:see more on the event actions that can be monitored in slack’s official documentation.some mitigations could only be implemented by slack.implement least privilege for incoming webhookswebhooks should default to only working in the defined channel. multi-channel webhooks/overrides should be a separate application or opt-in setting. since the override feature is nested under a “setup instructions” pane that requires user interaction to display, many users are not aware of it. webhooks should not be able to post to announcement-only/admin-only channels unless that channel is explicitly defined in the webhook configuration.improved awareness of secrets handlingnone of the text on the incoming webhook configuration page asserts the importance of secure storage of the webhook url. this issue paired with the hidden “features” of incoming webhooks may lead to users assuming low-to-no risk associated with webhooks, as is supported by the frequency of webhooks publicly committed.application verificationapps that have not been reviewed by slack and are not local to the workspace should have limited functionality or require further verification. consider a process similar to the google oauth verification process, where unverified apps using high-risk scopes require additional developer identity verification and/or are capped to a certain number of users to avoid widespread abuse.webhooks are credential tools that provide access to posting functionality within a workspace.\\xa0though data cannot be exposed through webhooks on slack, we do recommend that workspace owners or admins invalidate publicly exposed webhook urls and generate new ones. to help slack admins with that diligence, we\\xa0proactively scrape github for publicly exposed webhooks and invalidate them. webhooks are safe as long as they remain secret since the webhook url itself is unguessable.\\xa0we also recommend workspace owners and admins use\\xa0these best practices\\xa0for storing credentials safely and that they review\\xa0this guide\\xa0to sending messages using incoming webhooks.we also provide additional features to support the proper oversight of app installation and usage within workspaces, which help workspace owners and admins protect their workspaces. we allow teams to require admin approvals on all apps, and recommend they establish and follow basic security diligence procedures before permitting apps to be added into a workspace. our security recommendations for approving apps can be found\\xa0here.tags: phishing, slack, webhooksinsights reportat&t cybersecurity

trail of bits recently published a security assessment of the kubernetes platform. the intent of the audit was to identify and document existing risks and vulnerabilities of the platform, ultimately providing recommendations to improve its security posture.the assessment team found configuration and deployment of kubernetes to be non-trivial, with certain components having “confusing default settings, missing operational controls, and implicitly defined security controls”. this presents a need to understand the vulnerabilities and limitations of the platform itself, in addition to passing a high technical barrier of entry.each managed cloud service may remediate these issues differently (or not at all). according to google, “the report also calls out kubernetes’ default settings. in gke, we’ve been actively changing these over time, including turning off abac and basic authentication by default, to make sure new clusters you create are more secure.”\\xa0 abac is attribute-based access control.insecure defaults may have inconsistent fixes between managed platforms, and new protections may not apply to earlier versions. a well-intentioned administrator may also re-enable insecure settings to restore previous functionality or compatibility.because of this, our new detections are focused not only on potential attacks but on environmental awareness with an emphasis on multi-cloud support.managed services such as amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) and google kubernetes engine (gke) use a shared responsibility model which describe the role of security of the cloud and security in the cloud (see: the gke shared responsibility model versus eks).the good news is that this model clearly defines things that aren’t your responsibility - like the underlying infrastructure, the etcd database, and control plane nodes. the bad news is that you also need to understand what you are responsible for in order to implement the proper security monitoring and controls, and this includes platform-specific implementations such as defining and protecting your security groups or iam roles.api server flags, security control defaults, and the kubernetes patch version may also be considered in their purview for new systems, while any modifications to that or continued use of legacy systems become yours. through correlation rules you are able to better track these security regressions.logs are the foundation of security monitoring and the key to understanding who is doing what on your systems. usm anywhere supports log collection for aws, gcp, and azure, which significantly expedites the collection and normalization of log data.in addition to the kubernetes control plane logs, you should also remember to monitor the associated api logs for the cloud services such as api calls to eks or gke.for cloud-managed kubernetes logging you’ll need to understand which logs you need, where to send them, and any limitations that may influence your decisions. for example, gke container logs are removed when their host pod is removed, if the log storage disk runs out of space, or when logs are periodically rotated. once exported to an external source such as stackdriver though, retention is only affected by the policy (if any) set on that platform and the events can be easily ingested into the siem.see the following tips to maximize your log coverage:gkekubernetes audit logging is integrated with cloud audit logs and stackdriver logging.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0admin activity log - contains api calls for administrative, state-changing actions on resources; enabled by default, no cost\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0data access log - contains api calls for read actions on resources and user-driven api calls on user-provided resource data; disabled by default, can be expensiveeksamazon eks integrates with cloudtrail to log eks api by calls by users, roles, or services as events. amazon eks control plane logs are delivered to cloudwatch. the control plane log streams include kubernetes api server component logs (api), audit (audit), authenticator (authenticator), controller manager (controllermanager), and scheduler (scheduler).once these logs are in place, they are ready to be ingested by your security analytics or log management platform.from here, you’d typically have to ask yourself how to monitor these logs. how does the log syntax for unauthenticated requests differ between cloudwatch and stackdriver? what interesting platform-specific api events might exist, such as association of aws iam with a kubernetes service account? fortunately, this part is already done for you in usm anywhere.we have released the following cloud kubernetes correlation rules that support both eks and gke, including:tags: cloud security, logging, kubernetes, containers, container securityinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",

            "{'titel': 'why should you use correlation rules on top of traditional signatures', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthe at&t cybersecurity alien labs team is in charge of writing correlation rules and releasing threat intelligence updates on a day-to-day basis. when researchers in the team find new malware families or threats, we always try to find the best approach to keep our customers protected. in this blog, we will look into some of the differences between signatures and correlation rules.signatures are the values (sequence of bytes, string patterns, etc.) that security products use to detect known malicious behavior. for example: snort/suricata rules, antivirus signatures and yara rules.on the other hand, correlation is the processing of the event stream in order to identify important events or patterns of events within large volumes of data. the logic to identify these events is defined in a correlation rule.to clearly see the advantages of using these correlation rules and how they usually complement traditional rules, we will look at some examples like baldr stealer, ursnif banking trojan and alpc 0-day vulnerability and how we find the best approach.example 1: malware versioningin this first example, we will cover how a malware family can evolve with time and how the behavior and configuration can change between versions. in those cases, signatures can lose their detection criteria and stop triggering alerts. a great example of this is the baldr malware that has been present since january 2019 and has presented major modifications through different versions.sophos has written a great report called baldr vs the world where you can find a lot of information about this malware and also compare the differences of version 2.x with version 3. if we analyze some of the samples to see the network connections performed to command and control server, we can easily observe the differences introduced in every version release.baldr version 1.x.xthe first discovered version of baldr was using a simple http post request with victim’s information contained in the uri. as you can see, it makes so easy to write a nids signature to detect the pattern within the network packets.baldr version 2.xin the second version, or at least in version 2.2 and above, they changed the previous request and now the communication with command and control is encrypted with a xor key. here we can see the initial beacon where xor key is always sent to the victim along with the version separated by “;” delimiter, more difficult to detect with signatures but still possible.baldr version 3.xfinally in the third version, the communication method is pretty similar to the one used in the second version and they are still using a xor key. however, they changed the delimiter by “~;~” and now they are also sending some configuration settings. these changes force us to create a new signature.knowing that, it is clear that network signatures written for version 1.x.x won’t work with versions 2.x and 3.x, the same thing happens with signatures for 2.x and 3.x. this scenario makes us think that if there were a new version, it would not be detected with the existing signatures and we will need to keep researching and creating new signatures whenever a new version of the malware is released.instead of that, we could try to observe all the actions performed by malware from the initial attack vector to the final command and control communication and correlate the events to create a detection. based on the research made into the malware family, attackers used two different methods to distribute and infect victims: crafted ace files, which exploit the winrar cve-2018-20250 vulnerability and also rtf documents targeting microsoft office products with cve-2018-0802 vulnerability.correlation rules could have helped us detect those attacks from the initial access phase and from the actions performed in victim’s systems. here is a list of possible pseudo-correlation rules:example 2: malware with many indicatorssometimes a malware family is difficult to detect because it doesn’t use http for beaconing, the communication is hidden or any other circumstances. a common approach when you can’t detect the communication is to keep track of all the malicious infrastructure to keep updating the indicators, making it very time consuming and inefficient. this is the case of ursnif malware, a banking trojan that tries to steal user information such as account credentials. if we take a look at the existing signatures for this malware, we will find a large amount of nids signatures and yara rules that tries to detect some of the indicators of compromise present in the samples.on the other hand, correlation rules can be used to detect malicious patterns in the behavior and benefit from the advantages discussed above. the following correlation rules could detect the ursnif malware without the need to update or create new signatures whenever new indicators are present.example 3: new malware or attack with no existing signaturesanother interesting scenario to demonstrate the advantages of correlation rules is when a new malware or attack begins to appear and there is no signature present to detect it. in those cases, an existing correlation rule, looking for suspicious behaviors that normally don’t happen in a system, could detect it.to explain this example we will talk about the alpc 0-day vulnerability affecting microsoft windows systems. this vulnerability was publicly released without any patch and many systems were vulnerable to it. since it was a local privilege escalation (lpe) and only a proof of concept (poc) was available, network and endpoint signatures were nonexistent and not enough to detect a possible exploitation. by doing quick research about the method used to perform the privilege escalation, the list of correlation rules that detects the threat is:we have talked about the benefits and advantages that correlation rules provide when we want to create detection methods. however, there are also some important things to take into consideration: there are no silver bullets in security, and it is better to be conservative and complement different methods and technologies to improve your detection capabilities. use regular signatures and iocs whenever you can, as they are fast to write and deploy, and have very high confidence.some of the cons of using correlations rules are:tags: alien labs, ids signatures, correlation

            "{'titel': 'malware using new ezuri memory loader', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog was written by ofer caspi and fernando martinez of at&t alien labsmultiple threat actors have recently started using a go language (golang) tool to act as a packer and avoid antivirus detection. additionally, the ezuri memory loader tool acts as a malware loader and executes its payload in memory, without writing the file to disk. while this technique is known and commonly used by windows malware, it is less popular in linux environments. the loader decrypts the malicious malware and executes it using memfd create (as described in this blog in 2018). when creating a process, the system returns a file descriptor to an anonymous file in \\'/proc/pid/fd/\\' which is visible only in the filesystem.figure 1 shows a code snippet from the loader, containing the information it uses in order to decrypt the payload using the aes algorithm. figure 1. loader code snippet via alien labs analysis.the loader, written in golang, is taken from the \"ezuri\" code on github via the user guitmz. this user originally created the elf loader around march 2019, when he wrote a blog about the technique to run elf executables from memory and shared the loader on his github. additionally, a similar user ‘tmz’ (presumably associated with the previously mentioned ‘guitmz’) posted this same code in late august, on a small forum where malware samples are shared.the guitmz user even ran tests against virustotal to prove the efficiency of the code, uploading a detected linux.cephei sample (35308b8b770d2d4f78299262f595a0769e55152cb432d0efc42292db01609a18) with 30/61 av detections in virustotal, compared to the zero av detections by the same sample hidden with the ezuri code (ddbb714157f2ef91c1ec350cdf1d1f545290967f61491404c81b4e6e52f5c41f).the execution flow of the loader is to first decrypt the payload and then execute it from memory (figure 2):figure 2. execution flow, retrieved from alien labs analysis.guitmz gave this sample the name ezuri, probably after the card with the same name from the card game “magic: the gathering.” \\xa0this card has the capability to “regenerate another target elf,” reflecting the \\xa0malware’s capability of loading and executing an elf file in memory.at&t alien labs team accessed guitmz’s upload of code for analysis. the tool is written in golang and is intuitive to use. when executing, it first asks the path for the payload to be encrypted, along with the password to be used for aes encryption. if no password is given, the tool generates one, which is used to hide the malware within the loader. after the user\\'s input, the packer compiles the loader with the payload encrypted within it, so it can be decrypted and executed in memory once it is placed in the victim’s system. figure 4 shows the main function of the executable, where the file is first decrypted by “aesdec” to then be run in memory by “runfrommemory”. figure 3 shows ezuri main function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.figure 4 shows the “runfrommemory” function used to execute the payload in memory without placing the detectable malware on disk.figure 4 shows ezuri runfrommemory function, retrieved from alien labs analysis.to use the tool, the user will be requested to enter the file to be hidden, with a target process name as well as an optional aes key for encryption (figure 5):figure 5 shows ezuri execution, retrieved from alien labs analysis.at&t alien labs has identified several malware authors leveraging the ezuri loader in the last few months, including teamtnt, which was the first identified. teamtnt is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least april 2020, when the security firm trend micro first reported on them. the main focus of the group is to target docker systems with misconfigurations, as well as unprotected and exposed management apis, to later install ddos bots and cryptominers in the infected systems. a few months after the trend micro report, in august 2020, cado security found new developments in the teamtnt group. in october 2020, palo alto networks unit42 identified new variants of the cryptomining malware used by teamtnt named “black-t.” this sample first installs three network scanners, and then inspects memory in an attempt to retrieve any type of credentials located in the memory. additionally, unit42 identified several german-language strings in some of the tnt scripts.the last sample identified by palo alto networks unit42 is actually an ezuri loader. the decrypted payload is an elf file packed with upx, which is a known sample from teamtnt, first seen in june 2020 (e15550481e89dbd154b875ce50cc5af4b49f9ff7b837d9ac5b5594e5d63966a3).the techniques and code similarities between the original tool, named ezuri, and the one recently used by teamtnt are vast. the most evident one being the \\'ezuri\\' string in the compiled binary (figure 6):figure 6 shows ezuri string in teamtnt\\xa0sample retrieved from alien labs analysis.using this packer, the antivirus (av) detection drops dramatically. looking at the teamtnt malware detections before using ezuri packer (b494ca3b7bae2ab9a5197b81e928baae5b8eac77dfdc7fe1223fee8f27024772), we see 28/62 av detections of the malware, while the ezuri packed version (751014e0154d219dea8c2e999714c32fd98f817782588cd7af355d2488eb1c80) drops to only 3/64 av detections.in addition to teamtnt, there were several gafgyt samples observed (popular iot device malware with ddos attacks purposes). several malware authors have been using an open source golang tool to act as a malware loader, using a known technique to load the elf binaries into memory and avoid using easy-to-detect files on disk. the authors use the open source tool ezuri, to load its previously seen payloads and avoid antivirus detections on the file. the following associated detection methods are in use by alien labs. they can be used by readers to tune or deploy detections in their own environments or for aiding additional research.yara rulesthe following technical indicators are associated with the reported intelligence. a list of indicators is also available in the otx pulse. please note, the pulse may include other activities related but

            "{'titel': 'trickbot bazarloader in depth', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsofer caspi, a fellow alien labs researcher, co-authored this blog.at&t alien labs actively tracks the trickbot group through an automated malware analysis system, hunting, and in-depth technical research. on april 20th, 2020 independent security researchers “pancak3lullz” (@pancak3lullz) and vitali kremez (@vk_intel) posted a tweet regarding two new trickbot modules aptly named “bazarloader” and “bazarbackdoor” after attempted command and control (c2) communications with the emercoin dns (emerdns) .bazar domains. emerdns is desirable for attackers because it is a distributed blockchain that is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. alien labs’ automated malware analysis engine had picked up these samples a few days earlier (ex: 7c93d9175a38c23d44d76d9a883f7f3da1e244c2ab6c3ac9f29a9c9e20d20a5f)bleepingcomputer posted a blog with input from vitali kremez regarding a phishing campaign distributed through the sendgrid email marketing platform delivering covid-19 lures that ultimately led to the trickbot bazarbackdoor. the purpose of this blog is to provide additional technical details and an in-depth study of the signed trickbot bazarloader.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0since trickbot was discovered in 2016 it has been involved in information stealing, credential theft, ransomware, bitcoin mining, and loading other common crimeware malware as a first or second stage loader. for initial access as a first stage loader it typically accomplishes its objective through spear phishing links (t1192) or spear phishing attachments (t1193) using macro enabled microsoft office files. as a second stage payload and dynamic link library (dll) it is frequently loaded by emotet. to a lesser extent trickbot has been loaded by ostap javascript downloader and buer loader. in higher priority, higher profile trickbot anchor campaigns that target enterprises, powertrick and more_eggs/terraloader have been used to load other frameworks.trickbot has recently added a remote desktop protocol (rdp) brute force scanner module, an active directory (ad) harvesting module, and the mexec executor module. there are some indications that trickbot may be moving away from their mshare, mworm, and tabdll modules for retrieving payloads from urls in favor of the “nworm” module performing this task. it is important to note that trickbot group prefers to use shellcode “file-less” modules making detection more difficult.alien labs has previously identified digitally signed trickbot loaders, one of which was signed by an entity named “vb corporate pty. ltd.” pivoting in virustotal on the signer shows the first submission was on 2020-01-02 20:24:57. historically, the trickbot group has continued to reuse their revoked certificates to sign trickbot loaders as long as six months after the initial date of detection on virustotal. a list of known trickbot signers is included below. the associated signature serial numbers are included in the yara rule in the appendix.the trickbot bazarloader authors have produced an advanced module, with a significant amount of obfuscation. the bazarloader/cryptor uses multiple routines to hide api calls and embedded strings, which are then decrypted and resolved at runtime. once executed, the loader will allocate memory to store and decrypt its shellcode, which will be allocated to a numa node for faster execution. after allocation and decryption, the next instructions will jump to the shellcode that will be executed on the heap.next, the malware will try to communicate with .bazar domain c2 servers. once the c2 has been established, the loader will try to inject its payload into a system process using the process hollowing technique (t1093), which will create a suspended thread, unmap the destination image from memory, allocate new memory in the target process, copy the shellcode into the target process, set the thread context, and resume the process. in the sample analyzed, 1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83, the loader will first attempt to inject into an “svchost” process, and if injection fails, it will try to inject into the “explorer.exe” process, and if injection fails again as a last-ditch effort the loader will attempt to inject into the “cmd.exe” process. for persistence the loader will create a registry key under “hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\winlogon\\\\userinit”.the malware uses the windows api “virtualallocexnuma” function to allocate memory for its shellcode to be executed. the “virtualallocexnuma” function is used to allocate memory on a numa node, which allows for faster execution. the implementation can be seen in figure 1 below. it is interesting to note that the “virtualallocexnuma” function is not commonly used in process injection.figure 1. api resolution and shellcode decryption routinesin figure 1 above the bazarloader allocates memory using the uncommon “virtualallocexnuma” routine, and then it uses two iterations of the decryption routine to decrypt its shellcode. in the second call to the decrypt function some of the encryption key bytes are changed based on function parameters. in

            "{'titel': 'a hipaa compliance checklist', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsmaintaining security and compliance with hipaa, the health insurance portability and accountability act, is growing ever more challenging. the networks that house protected health information (phi or ephi) are becoming larger and more complex — especially as organizations move data to the cloud. at the same time, security professionals are faced with an evolving threat landscape of increasingly sophisticated threat actors and methods of attack.for example, 2018 threat intelligence research by at&t alien\\xa0labs reports a rise in the number of targeted ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. these attacks are often backed by organized criminals who see opportunities for making money from health care providers and other similar entities who must protect and keep assets, systems, and networks continuously operating.one such criminal group operating the samsam ransomware is thought to have earned more than $5 million dollars by manually compromising critical healthcare networks. and, according to alienvault labs, the methods used by samsam are more akin to a targeted attack than typical opportunistic ransomware.to help address these security challenges and ensure adherence to compliance mandates, security and it professionals should consider how people, processes, and technology can be used together to create a holistic it security compliance program that simplifies preparation, auditing and reporting, as well as ongoing security risk management and breach monitoring and response. here’s a five-step hipaa compliance checklist to get started.certification and ongoing hipaa compliancehipaa sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. any entity that deals with protected health information must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. in 2009, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act was adopted to promote the “meaningful use of health information technology” and address the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information. although there is no standard or implementation specification that requires a covered entity to “certify” compliance, the evaluation standard § 164.308(a)(8) requires covered entities to perform ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations that establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements. evaluations can be performed and documented internally or by an external organization that provides evaluation or “certification” services. however, hitech requires the hhs office for civil rights (ocr) to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the hipaa privacy, security, and breach notification rules.step 1: start with a comprehensive risk assessment and gap analysisyour compliance strategy should start with a solid foundation, which is why the first step in your journey to hipaa compliance should be a readiness assessment that includes a comprehensive risk and compliance analysis of your electronic health record (ehr) environment. this assessment is often best done by a third party with expertise in healthcare security and compliance, as hipaa regulations can be confusing and cumbersome. using a third party with the necessary expertise will ensure you don’t miss or misunderstand the required regulations, and it will save you time as they will likely have a hipaa checklist to reference.\\xa0your consultant can perform an initial evaluation of your entire security program to determine its adherence to hipaa regulations and the level of readiness to proceed with the “certification” process. it’s worth noting that the ocr does not actually “certify” hipaa compliance (see side bar), however there are organizations outside of the ocr that do provide “certification” services, and many organizations take advantage of these certification services to prove compliance. as a result of the evaluation, your consultant should provide a comprehensive report that may include such things as:according to the ocr, organizations that have aligned their security programs to the national institute for standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework may find it helpful as a starting place to identify potential gaps in their compliance with the hipaa security rule. addressing these gaps can bolster compliance with the security rule and improve the organization’s ability to secure ephi and other critical information and business processes. read how nist “maps” to the hipaa security rule in the hipaa security rule crosswalk to nist cybersecurity framework.step 2: remediate identified risks and address compliance gapsonce you’ve identified your organization’s risks, take immediate steps to address the gaps within your security program. again, a consultant who has practical experience in healthcare security will be very useful in providing strategic guidance, as well as advice on risk mitigation. many organizations use the same consultant who performed their initial risk assessment.your consultant may develop specific programs, policies, standards, and procedures, as well as support or help implement key security practices and controls. for example, they may assist in prioritizing vulnerabilities and make recommendations for remediation in your ehr environment. or, they may provide pre-packaged employee security awareness training that meets hipaa guidelines, such as educating employees on security risks and running them through attack scenarios.make use of security technology to help you more quickly address the gaps in your compliance program — and consider platforms versus point solutions, giving you the ability to address multiple issues at once. also, look for solutions that address both on-premises and multi-cloud environments as hipaa regulations apply to both (see guidance on hipaa & cloud computing).\\xa0for example, look for such use cases as the automation of asset discovery and the ability to categorize those assets into hipaa groups for easy management and reporting. those same solutions may also perform vulnerability assessments, automate the prioritization of vulnerabilities for mitigation, and integrate with ticketing solutions to ensure the most critical are being remediated while overall risks are mitigated.step 3: take advantage of automated compliance reportingthe evaluation standard of hipaa requires covered entities to perform and document ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations to establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements.most solutions do not cover all the requirements defined by the hipaa audit protocol, but they will give you a jump on your hipaa checklist.many security management platforms also include additional predefined event reports, such as reports by data source and data source type, helping to make daily compliance monitoring and reporting activities more efficient.also, look for an intuitive and flexible interface that allows you to quickly search and analyze your security data, as well as the ability to create and save custom views and export them as executive-ready reports.finally, solutions that provide centralized visibility of your cloud and on-premises assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and log data from firewalls and other security tools are key to giving you the most complete and contextual data set for maintaining and documenting continuous compliance.step 4: implement monitoring and breach notification protocolsthe breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and business associates to provide notifications if they experience a breach that involves unsecured protected health information.security management platforms can help to simplify and automate monitoring for breaches on your network, ensuring you are able to more quickly detect and contain a breach, as well as provide the required notifications.as more organizations in healthcare are migrating data and applications to the cloud, make sure the technology you’re choosing offers advanced threat detection across both on-premises and multi-cloud environments. simplify compliance management by choosing a solution that combines an array of essential security capabilities in one platform. these may include, but are not limited to: asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, endpoint detection and response, siem event correlation, file integrity monitoring (fim), and log management. by combining these use cases in a single dashboard, you are better able to quickly identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats that target your ehr environment.intelligence it key to threat detection and incident response, so consider vendors who have in-house research teams as well as access to external threat intelligence communities and other sources that can provide insight into the latest global threats and vulnerabilities — and in particular, those that are specific to healthcare.however, intelligence without context will create lot of distracting “noise” for your team. so, check that the solution goes beyond just providing intelligence to incorporating it directly into your dashboard, including providing recommendations on how to respond to identified threats. with this intelligence and guidance at your fingertips, you can react quickly to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. and, you are assured of an always-up-to-date and optimally performing security monitoring solution.need more info on how to respond to a breach? see the hhs quick response checklist.step 5: continuously evaluate and manage riskwhether you are managing ongoing hipaa compliance internally or are using an external organization, avoid last-minute scrambling for annual evaluations and audits by employing a year-round risk management program. such a program requires having real-time visibility of your environment, including system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall information, and product upgrades.use a unified platform to gain this visibility and enable monitoring in a central location (opposed to various point solutions). here are a few examples of where a platform would be helpful for continuous risk and compliance management:examples: use automated asset discovery for on-premises and cloud environments and then create asset groups such as business critical assets or hipaa assets for ongoing monitoring, management and reporting. identify systems with known vulnerabilities and use correlation rules to detect threats.examples: monitor for successful and failed logon events to assets. monitor for communications with known malicious ip addresses or use file integrity monitoring (fim) to detect, assess and report on changes to system binaries, and content locations. schedule vulnerability scans, automate assessments, and plan for mitigation. review events and detected incidents.examples: aggregate events from across on-premises and multi-cloud environments. classify threats based on their risk level. monitor for stolen credentials, malware-based compromises such as communication to a known command and control (c&c) server, anomalous user and admin activities, file integrity, and vulnerabilities.example: automate forensics tasks to be executed in response to a detected threat and simplify forensics investigations with filters, search and reporting capabilities for event and log data. automate actions to contain threats, such as isolating systems from the network.use out-of-the box reporting to document that you’ve made an accurate assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic phi — and to quickly show the status of technical controls that align to hipaa or other regulations.maintaining adherence to hipaa is no small feat considering the dozens of criteria that are considered in the hipaa audit checklist. attempting to manage your compliance program manually and without the help of expert healthcare security consultants will not only take up massive amounts of time, it could result in your team missing an essential component of the regulation, or worse yet, enduring a breach that compromises patient data or takes down the network. however, with the right mix of people, processes and technology, it’s not an impossible to stay on top of compliance management while ensuring your network is secure and patient data protected year-round.hipaa regulationshipaa privacy rule: this rule set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by three types of covered entities: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and health care providers who conduct the standard healthcare transactions electronically.\\xa0hipaa security rule: this rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. the privacy rule is located at 45 cfr part 160 and subparts a and e of part 164\\xa0(e-phi).hipaa breach and notification rule: the hipaa breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information.tags: ransomware, risk management,

            "{'titel': 'slack phishing attacks using webhooks', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsslack is a cloud-based messaging platform that is commonly used in workplace communications. it is feature-rich, offering additional functionality such as video calling and screen sharing in addition to a marketplace containing thousands of third-party applications and add-ons.slack incoming webhooks allow you to post messages from your applications to slack. by specifying a unique url, your message body, and a destination channel, you can send a message to any webhook that you know the url for in any workspace, regardless of membership. webhooks take the format of https://hooks.slack.com/services/t00000000/b00000000/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.generally, slack webhooks are considered a low risk integration due to the following assumptions:a deeper dive into webhooks shows that this is not entirely accurate.first, a channel override allows you to override the previously specified webhook target channel by adding the “channel” key to your json payload. if you gain access to a webhook for one channel, you can use it in others. considering sending to #general, #engineering, and other default or common channels to target a wider audience.in some cases, this can also override channel posting permissions (such as admin-only posting).slack documentation suggests that allowed target channels are based on the original creator of the webhook: “posting_to_general_channel_denied is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the \"#general\" channel for a workspace where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. you\\'ll receive this error with a http 403.” so if you can find a webhook created by an admin - congrats, you can post to admin channels!a quick search on github shows 130,989 public code results containing slack webhook urls, with a majority containing the full unique webhook value.the last assumption is true - webhooks can only accept data. that’s where we get creative.the process itself is fairly simple:as mentioned earlier, github is a good start for scraping publicly committed webhook data.first, create an app. you will also need a web server to handle the oauth flow.slack apps don’t require oauth, but in this case we will be using the slack api to access data in workspaces where the malicious app is installed. when the user attempts to install the application, they must approve the requested oauth scopes. their approval is sent to the oauth client, which retrieves an access token from the authorization server. this access token may be used to retrieve data using the specified service scopes until authorization is revoked. read more about using oauth 2.0 here.you will also need to set your oauth scope(s) to whatever data you want to exfiltrate from slack. in my case, i chose files:read in order to access files on the victim\\'s workspace.your redirect url must be set to the oauth client url.the following code snippet can be used to handle the oauth 2.0 handshake using python and flask.the following payload will send a message to the #general channel associated with the unique webhook url. in this scenario, we’re claiming that the webhook configuration needs to be updated.payload:message:the link points to https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?scope=files:read&client_id=834500968371.846020497941, which is actually the shareable url for my malicious slack app.upon clicking, the user will be directed to install “webhook configuration”.at no point is it clear that the victim has interacted with any domain except for slack.com.after exchanging the temporary authorization code for the access token, you will receive a response from slack containing the access token in addition to some other data, including identifiers for the user, team, and enterprise they are part of.distribution statistics can also be tracked from your app’s distribution page at https://api.slack.com/apps/.once you receive the user’s access token, you are free to access data on their behalf. note that slack has mostly moved to using perspectival scopes, i.e. user tokens or bot tokens that give access within the context of that entity. what you can access depends on the requester access and the scopes that your app initially requested. in my example, files:read was used.the above request allows us to list all files that the user has access to, and subsequently download each of them using the access token and the private url returned by the files.list method.the example in this post shows a simple phishing and data exfiltration flow. in theory, this could also be used for propagation of attacks across users and workspaces.the chat.postmessage method allows you to send messages via channel or direct message. with the chat:write:user permission, messages can be sent as_user using the context of the user token. compromising one member of your workspace would allow more targeted or convincing malicious messages to be sent to channels they are part of or directly to their peers, similar to the high-profile gsuite phishing attack in 2018 which was also covered by us in a previous blog post.users of shared channels can direct message users participating in the shared channels across workspaces. targeting those users would allow for compromise across multiple workspaces.application whitelistingadministrators have the option to manage their users’ slack applications. in less sensitive workspaces, this may involve only allowing apps from the app directory. applications added to the directory are required to go through slack’s own app security review process prior to approval.more sensitive environments may call for application whitelisting/application approval, requiring an administrator to review and approve applications before installation. this option is strongly recommended for companies looking to comply with ccpa, gdpr, and other regulations that require tracking of sharing of personal data with third parties.detection of suspicious oauth applicationsif whitelisting is not an option or you’d like an extra layer of defense, you may be interested in detecting suspicious slack oauth applications that users are adding to your workspace. by ingesting slack audit log data into a security analytics platform such as usm anywhere, one can alert on these suspicious actions.for example, some items of interest might include:see more on the event actions that can be monitored in slack’s official documentation.some mitigations could only be implemented by slack.implement least privilege for incoming webhookswebhooks should default to only working in the defined channel. multi-channel webhooks/overrides should be a separate application or opt-in setting. since the override feature is nested under a “setup instructions” pane that requires user interaction to display, many users are not aware of it. webhooks should not be able to post to announcement-only/admin-only channels unless that channel is explicitly defined in the webhook configuration.improved awareness of secrets handlingnone of the text on the incoming webhook configuration page asserts the importance of secure storage of the webhook url. this issue paired with the hidden “features” of incoming webhooks may lead to users assuming low-to-no risk associated with webhooks, as is supported by the frequency of webhooks publicly committed.application verificationapps that have not been reviewed by slack and are not local to the workspace should have limited functionality or require further verification. consider a process similar to the google oauth verification process, where unverified apps using high-risk scopes require additional developer identity verification and/or are capped to a certain number of users to avoid widespread abuse.webhooks are credential tools that provide access to posting functionality within a workspace.\\xa0though data cannot be exposed through webhooks on slack, we do recommend that workspace owners or admins invalidate publicly exposed webhook urls and generate new ones. to help slack admins with that diligence, we\\xa0proactively scrape github for publicly exposed webhooks and invalidate them. webhooks are safe as long as they remain secret since the webhook url itself is unguessable.\\xa0we also recommend workspace owners and admins use\\xa0these best practices\\xa0for storing credentials safely and that they review\\xa0this guide\\xa0to sending messages using incoming webhooks.we also provide additional features to support the proper oversight of app installation and usage within workspaces, which help workspace owners and admins protect their workspaces. we allow teams to require admin approvals on all apps, and recommend they establish and follow basic security diligence procedures before permitting apps to be added into a workspace. our security recommendations for approving apps can be found\\xa0here.tags: phishing, slack, webhooksinsights reportat&t cybersecurity

            "{'titel': 'security monitoring for managed cloud kubernetes', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsphoto by\\xa0chuttersnap\\xa0on\\xa0unsplashkubernetes (k8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. it has recently seen rapid adoption across enterprise environments.many environments rely on managed kubernetes services such as google kubernetes engine (gke) and amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) to take advantage of the benefits of both containerization and the cloud. google cloud platform, for example, offers advanced cluster management features such as automatic upgrades, load balancing, and stackdriver logging. amazon web services (aws) provides kubernetes(r) role based access control (rbac) integration with aws iam authenticator and logging via cloudtrail and cloudwatch.however, adoption of these cloud-managed services can introduce new challenges to your monitoring and detection capabilities, such as:the purpose of this post and associated release is to help fill in the detection gaps between kubernetes, eks, and gke, and provide normalized detection strategies that include multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.with their advanced features, cloud-managed services add potential and new attack vectors as well as room for error or confusion.kubernetes itself is highly complex; trail of bits recently published a security assessment of the kubernetes platform. the intent of the audit was to identify and document existing risks and vulnerabilities of the platform, ultimately providing recommendations to improve its security posture.the assessment team found configuration and deployment of kubernetes to be non-trivial, with certain components having “confusing default settings, missing operational controls, and implicitly defined security controls”. this presents a need to understand the vulnerabilities and limitations of the platform itself, in addition to passing a high technical barrier of entry.each managed cloud service may remediate these issues differently (or not at all). according to google, “the report also calls out kubernetes’ default settings. in gke, we’ve been actively changing these over time, including turning off abac and basic authentication by default, to make sure new clusters you create are more secure.”\\xa0 abac is attribute-based access control.insecure defaults may have inconsistent fixes between managed platforms, and new protections may not apply to earlier versions. a well-intentioned administrator may also re-enable insecure settings to restore previous functionality or compatibility.because of this, our new detections are focused not only on potential attacks but on environmental awareness with an emphasis on multi-cloud support.managed services such as amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) and google kubernetes engine (gke) use a shared responsibility model which describe the role of security of the cloud and security in the cloud (see: the gke shared responsibility model versus eks).the good news is that this model clearly defines things that aren’t your responsibility - like the underlying infrastructure, the etcd database, and control plane nodes. the bad news is that you also need to understand what you are responsible for in order to implement the proper security monitoring and controls, and this includes platform-specific implementations such as defining and protecting your security groups or iam roles.api server flags, security control defaults, and the kubernetes patch version may also be considered in their purview for new systems, while any modifications to that or continued use of legacy systems become yours. through correlation rules you are able to better track these security regressions.logs are the foundation of security monitoring and the key to understanding who is doing what on your systems. usm anywhere supports log collection for aws, gcp, and azure, which significantly expedites the collection and normalization of log data.in addition to the kubernetes control plane logs, you should also remember to monitor the associated api logs for the cloud services such as api calls to eks or gke.for cloud-managed kubernetes logging you’ll need to understand which logs you need, where to send them, and any limitations that may influence your decisions. for example, gke container logs are removed when their host pod is removed, if the log storage disk runs out of space, or when logs are periodically rotated. once exported to an external source such as stackdriver though, retention is only affected by the policy (if any) set on that platform and the events can be easily ingested into the siem.see the following tips to maximize your log coverage:gkekubernetes audit logging is integrated with cloud audit logs and stackdriver logging.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0admin activity log - contains api calls for administrative, state-changing actions on resources;

            "{'titel': 'why should you use correlation rules on top of traditional signatures', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthe at&t cybersecurity alien labs team is in charge of writing correlation rules and releasing threat intelligence updates on a day-to-day basis. when researchers in the team find new malware families or threats, we always try to find the best approach to keep our customers protected. in this blog, we will look into some of the differences between signatures and correlation rules.signatures are the values (sequence of bytes, string patterns, etc.) that security products use to detect known malicious behavior. for example: snort/suricata rules, antivirus signatures and yara rules.on the other hand, correlation is the processing of the event stream in order to identify important events or patterns of events within large volumes of data. the logic to identify these events is defined in a correlation rule.to clearly see the advantages of using these correlation rules and how they usually complement traditional rules, we will look at some examples like baldr stealer, ursnif banking trojan and alpc 0-day vulnerability and how we find the best approach.example 1: malware versioningin this first example, we will cover how a malware family can evolve with time and how the behavior and configuration can change between versions. in those cases, signatures can lose their detection criteria and stop triggering alerts. a great example of this is the baldr malware that has been present since january 2019 and has presented major modifications through different versions.sophos has written a great report called baldr vs the world where you can find a lot of information about this malware and also compare the differences of version 2.x with version 3. if we analyze some of the samples to see the network connections performed to command and control server, we can easily observe the differences introduced in every version release.baldr version 1.x.xthe first discovered version of baldr was using a simple http post request with victim’s information contained in the uri. as you can see, it makes so easy to write a nids signature to detect the pattern within the network packets.baldr version 2.xin the second version, or at least in version 2.2 and above, they changed the previous request and now the communication with command and control is encrypted with a xor key. here we can see the initial beacon where xor key is always sent to the victim along with the version separated by “;” delimiter, more difficult to detect with signatures but still possible.baldr version 3.xfinally in the third version, the communication method is pretty similar to the one used in the second version and they are still using a xor key. however, they changed the delimiter by “~;~” and now they are also sending some configuration settings. these changes force us to create a new signature.knowing that, it is clear that network signatures written for version 1.x.x won’t work with versions 2.x and 3.x, the same thing happens with signatures for 2.x and 3.x. this scenario makes us think that if there were a new version, it would not be detected with the existing signatures and we will need to keep researching and creating new signatures whenever a new version of the malware is released.instead of that, we could try to observe all the actions performed by malware from the initial attack vector to the final command and control communication and correlate the events to create a detection. based on the research made into the malware family, attackers used two different methods to distribute and infect victims: crafted ace files, which exploit the winrar cve-2018-20250 vulnerability and also rtf documents targeting microsoft office products with cve-2018-0802 vulnerability.correlation rules could have helped us detect those attacks from the initial access phase and from the actions performed in victim’s systems. here is a list of possible pseudo-correlation rules:example 2: malware with many indicatorssometimes a malware family is difficult to detect because it doesn’t use http for beaconing, the communication is hidden or any other circumstances. a common approach when you can’t detect the communication is to keep track of all the malicious infrastructure to keep updating the indicators, making it very time consuming and inefficient. this is the case of ursnif malware, a banking trojan that tries to steal user information such as account credentials. if we take a look at the existing signatures for this malware, we will find a large amount of nids signatures and yara rules that tries to detect some of the indicators of compromise present in the samples.on the other hand, correlation rules can be used to detect malicious patterns in the behavior and benefit from the advantages discussed above. the following correlation rules could detect the ursnif malware without the need to update or create new signatures whenever new indicators are present.example 3: new malware or attack with no existing signaturesanother interesting scenario to demonstrate the advantages of correlation rules is when a new malware or attack begins to appear and there is no signature present to detect it. in those cases, an existing correlation rule, looking for suspicious behaviors that normally don’t happen in a system, could detect it.to explain this example we will talk about the alpc 0-day vulnerability affecting microsoft windows systems. this vulnerability was publicly released without any patch and many systems were vulnerable to it. since it was a local privilege escalation (lpe) and only a proof of concept (poc) was available, network and endpoint signatures were nonexistent and not enough to detect a possible exploitation. by doing quick research about the method used to perform the privilege escalation, the list of correlation rules that detects the threat is:we have talked about the benefits and advantages that correlation rules provide when we want to create detection methods. however, there are also some important things to take into consideration: there are no silver bullets in security, and it is better to be conservative and complement different methods and technologies to improve your detection capabilities. use regular signatures and iocs whenever you can, as they are fast to write and deploy, and have very high confidence.some of the cons of using correlations rules are:tags: alien labs, ids signatures, correlation

            "{'titel': 'alien labs 2019 analysis of threat groups molerats and apt c 37', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsin 2019, several industry analyst reports confused the threat groups molerats and apt-c-37 due to their similarity, and this has led to some confusion and inaccuracy of attribution.for example, both groups target the middle east and north africa region (with a special emphasis on palestine territories). and, they both approach victims through the use of phishing emails that contain decoy documents (mostly in arabic) and contain themes concerning the political situation in the area.to improve understanding of the differences and similarities of the two groups (as well as the links between them), we at alien labs™ are providing an analysis of their 2019 activity.a recent spear-phishing document from moleratsapt-c-37, also known as pat-bear or the syrian electronic army (sea), was first seen in october 2015 targeting members of a terrorist organization. since 2015, however, apt-c-37 has broadened their objectives to include government agencies, armed forces leadership, media organizations, political activists, and diplomats. the group mostly targets victims in western countries, with the intent of defacing their websites and social accounts while leaving a public footprint after hacking one of their victims.in previous attacks, apt-c-37 targeted windows and android systems, utilizing popular commercial remote access trojans (rats) such as droidjack, spynote, njrat, sslove, and h-worm.molerats has been present in the cybercriminal landscape since 2012. in an analysis released by the kaspersky’s great (global research & analysis team) earlier this year on the gaza hacker team and their various subgroups, kaspersky concluded that molerats is gaza cybergang “group1.” the report also concluded that molerats (i.e. cybergang group 1) operates with a lower level of sophistication than other groups within the gaza hacker team. in addition, a 2016 article in security week reported that one of molerats campaigns (october 2016) heavily used popular rats like njrat and h-worm (aka houdini).october 2019: in molerats’ october operation, the attack was distributed as a phishing campaign in the middle east. emails included a microsoft word file attachment with the title “daily report on the most important palestinian developments for the day 9-9-2019.doc” — content that spoke to the political situation in palestine. when a victim opened the attachment, the malware performed the following:diagram of molerats october 2019 campaignseptember-october 2019: in molerat’s september campaign, the malware propagated through an executable with a fake pdf file. with the names “the case of muath ismail haniyeh.pdf.exe” and “interface.pdf.exe,” the executables are both signed under the name “foxitreader.”when a victim opened the attachment, the malware performed the following:diagram of molerats\\xa0september – october 2019 campaignaugust 2019: in august, molerats ran another campaign, however we did not detect the use of phishing. instead, alien labs identified a sample communicating with a new domain that used the same c&c pattern detected by an ids signature. you can find details and more on the open threat exchange (otx). the domain, which has been up since 2017, has two malicious files associated with it:january 2019: in january, molerats switched its tactics back to phishing with word documents that concealed a malicious vbscript. the vbs contained an encoded version of the malware, which was scheduled and executed after decryption. the malicious file corresponded to a version of the fraudrop trojan, packed with enigma as previously seen in other molerats’ samples, and it used the simple and fast multimedia library (smfl), which is commonly used for game development.diagram of molerats\\xa0january 2019 campaignnovember 2019: in november, alien labs discovered a new molerats sample. in this case, the group recycled the domain used in their january attack for c&c. in this campaign, an executable with an arabic name that translates to “winter government by names,” extracted and executed a modified version of the fraudrop trojan. molerats had attempted to hide the packer they were using and they modified the filename, however the c&c and beacon they used were the same and they were using the smf library for development.diagram of molerats november 2019 campaign\\xa0\\xa0apt-c-37\\xa0moleratsnames\\xa0targetstimelines\\xa0since october

three attacks below have been attributed to apt-c-37 and molerats, however it’s our opinion at alien labs that they don’t share the clear patterns of molerats or apt-c-37 we’ve seen prior to this blog.november 2019 (palestinian election): attributed on twitter by rising enterprise security to apt-c-37this campaign tried to utilize the palestinian elections as a theme for their phishing emails, and the target appeared to be the palestinian government. we observed the use of phishing emails in the campaign with fake documents themed after the elections that contained at least two different malicious files. the file names are (translated here):both files used a microsoft word icon in attempt to make the victims run the malicious executable. when executed it performed the following.diagram of november 2019 attributed on twitter to apt-c-37august 2019: attributed on twitter to apt-c-37this attack, attributed to apt-c-37 on twitter, is very similar to the november 2019 attack described above, however it did not use the palestinian elections to lure victims. this time, the threat group used another .exe which included a decoy word document titled “a new scandal for a hamas leader”. the execution was very similar to the november 2019 campaign, however this time the camouflaged lnk file was “history.lnk” and it installed a version of houdini rat.diagram of august 2019 campaign attributed on twitter to apt-c-37april 2019: attributed on twitter to apt-c-37in april 2019, security researchers on twitter observed another phishing email with an attached executable. when executed, the malware opened a document talking about the palestinian ministers to keep the victim entertained while it installed a lnk file “msofficee.lnk,” which is very close to the real “msoffice.lnk.” the file allowed the houdini rat to execute and gain persistence on the targeted machine.diagram of april 2019 campaign attributed on twitter to apt-c-37the three attacks above have the following similar characteristics:the above-mentioned target and the delivery methods suggest these attacks are being launched by molerats (note: the houdini rat is very popular in the middle east and cannot be used for attribution). however, in the opinion of alien labs, the other attack patterns make it hard for us to tie these attacks to molerats or apt-c-37, as they do not have a clear pattern that aligns to the samples previously associated with molerats or apt-c-37. in light of this, alien labs currently buckets these three attacks under an unattributed classification.yes, indeed, we have seen similar patterns between molerats and apt-c-37 in 2019. however, molerats has shown to be a more active group (even beyond 2019), with a more advanced tradecraft and methods that are more difficult to defend against due to the use of https, high rotation of malware, or even ip filtering to specific geolocations. therefore, we do not have a high level of confidence that the latest samples belong to any of these two groups or have a relationship at this time. having said this, we offer a caveat: of the samples we analyzed, we left three unattributed for the moment. through future analysis, we may find that these do fall under either molerats or apt-c-37. if that happens, we’ll keep you updated in otx.tags: malware, malware research, alien labs, molerats,

            "{'titel': 'trickbot bazarloader in depth', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsofer caspi, a fellow alien labs researcher, co-authored this blog.at&t alien labs actively tracks the trickbot group through an automated malware analysis system, hunting, and in-depth technical research. on april 20th, 2020 independent security researchers “pancak3lullz” (@pancak3lullz) and vitali kremez (@vk_intel) posted a tweet regarding two new trickbot modules aptly named “bazarloader” and “bazarbackdoor” after attempted command and control (c2) communications with the emercoin dns (emerdns) .bazar domains. emerdns is desirable for attackers because it is a distributed blockchain that is decentralized, cannot be censored, and cannot be altered, revoked or suspended by any authority. alien labs’ automated malware analysis engine had picked up these samples a few days earlier (ex: 7c93d9175a38c23d44d76d9a883f7f3da1e244c2ab6c3ac9f29a9c9e20d20a5f)bleepingcomputer posted a blog with input from vitali kremez regarding a phishing campaign distributed through the sendgrid email marketing platform delivering covid-19 lures that ultimately led to the trickbot bazarbackdoor. the purpose of this blog is to provide additional technical details and an in-depth study of the signed trickbot bazarloader.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0since trickbot was discovered in 2016 it has been involved in information stealing, credential theft, ransomware, bitcoin mining, and loading other common crimeware malware as a first or second stage loader. for initial access as a first stage loader it typically accomplishes its objective through spear phishing links (t1192) or spear phishing attachments (t1193) using macro enabled microsoft office files. as a second stage payload and dynamic link library (dll) it is frequently loaded by emotet. to a lesser extent trickbot has been loaded by ostap javascript downloader and buer loader. in higher priority, higher profile trickbot anchor campaigns that target enterprises, powertrick and more_eggs/terraloader have been used to load other frameworks.trickbot has recently added a remote desktop protocol (rdp) brute force scanner module, an active directory (ad) harvesting module, and the mexec executor module. there are some indications that trickbot may be moving away from their mshare, mworm, and tabdll modules for retrieving payloads from urls in favor of the “nworm” module performing this task. it is important to note that trickbot group prefers to use shellcode “file-less” modules making detection more difficult.alien labs has previously identified digitally signed trickbot loaders, one of which was signed by an entity named “vb corporate pty. ltd.” pivoting in virustotal on the signer shows the first submission was on 2020-01-02 20:24:57. historically, the trickbot group has continued to reuse their revoked certificates to sign trickbot loaders as long as six months after the initial date of detection on virustotal. a list of known trickbot signers is included below. the associated signature serial numbers are included in the yara rule in the appendix.the trickbot bazarloader authors have produced an advanced module, with a significant amount of obfuscation. the bazarloader/cryptor uses multiple routines to hide api calls and embedded strings, which are then decrypted and resolved at runtime. once executed, the loader will allocate memory to store and decrypt its shellcode, which will be allocated to a numa node for faster execution. after allocation and decryption, the next instructions will jump to the shellcode that will be executed on the heap.next, the malware will try to communicate with .bazar domain c2 servers. once the c2 has been established, the loader will try to inject its payload into a system process using the process hollowing technique (t1093), which will create a suspended thread, unmap the destination image from memory, allocate new memory in the target process, copy the shellcode into the target process, set the thread context, and resume the process. in the sample analyzed, 1e123a6c5d65084ca6ea78a26ec4bebcfc4800642fec480d1ceeafb1cacaaa83, the loader will first attempt to inject into an “svchost” process, and if injection fails, it will try to inject into the “explorer.exe” process, and if injection fails again as a last-ditch effort the loader will attempt to inject into the “cmd.exe” process. for persistence the loader will create a registry key under “hkey_local_machine\\\\software\\\\microsoft\\\\windows nt\\\\currentversion\\\\winlogon\\\\userinit”.the malware uses the windows api “virtualallocexnuma” function to allocate memory for its shellcode to be executed. the “virtualallocexnuma” function is used to allocate memory on a numa node, which allows for faster execution. the implementation can be seen in figure 1 below. it is interesting to note that the “virtualallocexnuma” function is not commonly used in process injection.figure 1. api resolution and shellcode decryption routinesin figure 1 above the bazarloader allocates memory using the uncommon “virtualallocexnuma” routine, and then it uses two iterations of the decryption routine to decrypt its shellcode. in the second call to the decrypt function some of the encryption key bytes are changed based on function parameters. in figure 2 below a representation of the decompiled decrypt routine can be seen importing the encryption key, modifying the encryption key bytes dependent on the parameters passed, and then decrypting the data.figure 2. decryption routinethe bazarloader authors have created dozens of decryption routines, and with almost each string including apis, dlls, and c2s there is a once per use unique decryption routine. an example of multiple decryption routines can be seen in figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 below.figure 3. decryption routinefigure 4. decryption routinefigure 5. decryption routinethe loader uses the same decryption technique described above to resolve the api calls it uses during execution. the windows api resolution can be seen in figure 6 below.figure 6. windows api resolutionfor injection, the malware resolves apis from the ntdll.dll after it loads from disk and checks that there are no inline hooks within its function, that could be created for example by av software that tracks those api calls.the targeted processes for injection can be seen in figure 7 below.figure 7. targeted svchost, explorer, and cmd windows processes\\xa0the bazarloader injection code can be seen

            "{'titel': 'a hipaa compliance checklist', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsmaintaining security and compliance with hipaa, the health insurance portability and accountability act, is growing ever more challenging. the networks that house protected health information (phi or ephi) are becoming larger and more complex — especially as organizations move data to the cloud. at the same time, security professionals are faced with an evolving threat landscape of increasingly sophisticated threat actors and methods of attack.for example, 2018 threat intelligence research by at&t alien\\xa0labs reports a rise in the number of targeted ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. these attacks are often backed by organized criminals who see opportunities for making money from health care providers and other similar entities who must protect and keep assets, systems, and networks continuously operating.one such criminal group operating the samsam ransomware is thought to have earned more than $5 million dollars by manually compromising critical healthcare networks. and, according to alienvault labs, the methods used by samsam are more akin to a targeted attack than typical opportunistic ransomware.to help address these security challenges and ensure adherence to compliance mandates, security and it professionals should consider how people, processes, and technology can be used together to create a holistic it security compliance program that simplifies preparation, auditing and reporting, as well as ongoing security risk management and breach

electronic transmission of health information. although there is no standard or implementation specification that requires a covered entity to “certify” compliance, the evaluation standard § 164.308(a)(8) requires covered entities to perform ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations that establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements. evaluations can be performed and documented internally or by an external organization that provides evaluation or “certification” services. however, hitech requires the hhs office for civil rights (ocr) to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the hipaa privacy, security, and breach notification rules.step 1: start with a comprehensive risk assessment and gap analysisyour compliance strategy should start with a solid foundation, which is why the first step in your journey to hipaa compliance should be a readiness assessment that includes a comprehensive risk and compliance analysis of your electronic health record (ehr) environment. this assessment is often best done by a third party with expertise in healthcare security and compliance, as hipaa regulations can be confusing and cumbersome. using a third party with the necessary expertise will ensure you don’t miss or misunderstand the required regulations, and it will save you time as they will likely have a hipaa checklist to reference.\\xa0your consultant can perform an initial evaluation of your entire security program to determine its adherence to hipaa regulations and the level of readiness to proceed with the “certification” process. it’s worth noting that the ocr does not actually “certify” hipaa compliance (see side bar), however there are organizations outside of the ocr that do provide “certification” services, and many organizations take advantage of these certification services to prove compliance. as a result of the evaluation, your consultant should provide a comprehensive report that may include such things as:according to the ocr, organizations that have aligned their security programs to the national institute for standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework may find it helpful as a starting place to identify potential gaps in their compliance with the hipaa security rule. addressing these gaps can bolster compliance with the security rule and improve the organization’s ability to secure ephi and other critical information and business processes. read how nist “maps” to the hipaa security rule in the hipaa security rule crosswalk to nist cybersecurity framework.step 2: remediate identified risks and address compliance gapsonce you’ve identified your organization’s risks, take immediate steps to address the gaps within your security program. again, a consultant who has practical experience in healthcare security will be very useful in providing strategic guidance, as well as advice on risk mitigation. many organizations use the same consultant who performed their initial risk assessment.your consultant may develop specific programs, policies, standards, and procedures, as well as support or help implement key security practices and controls. for example, they may assist in prioritizing vulnerabilities and make recommendations for remediation in your ehr environment. or, they may provide pre-packaged employee security awareness training that meets hipaa guidelines, such as educating employees on security risks and running them through attack scenarios.make use of security technology to help you more quickly address the gaps in your compliance program — and consider platforms versus point solutions, giving you the ability to address multiple issues at once. also, look for solutions that address both on-premises and multi-cloud environments as hipaa regulations apply to both (see guidance on hipaa & cloud computing).\\xa0for example, look for such use cases as the automation of asset discovery and the ability to categorize those assets into hipaa groups for easy management and reporting. those same solutions may also perform vulnerability assessments, automate the prioritization of vulnerabilities for mitigation, and integrate with ticketing solutions to ensure the most critical are being remediated while overall risks are mitigated.step 3: take advantage of automated compliance reportingthe evaluation standard of hipaa requires covered entities to perform and document ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations to establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements.most solutions do not cover all the requirements defined by the hipaa audit protocol, but they will give you a jump on your hipaa checklist.many security management platforms also include additional predefined event reports, such as reports by data source and data source type, helping to make daily compliance monitoring and reporting activities more efficient.also, look for an intuitive and flexible interface that allows you to quickly search and analyze your security data, as well as the ability to create and save custom views and export them as executive-ready reports.finally, solutions that provide centralized visibility of your cloud and on-premises assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and log data from firewalls and other security tools are key to giving you the most complete and contextual data set for maintaining and documenting continuous compliance.step 4: implement monitoring and breach notification protocolsthe breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and business associates to provide notifications if they experience a breach that involves unsecured protected health information.security management platforms can help to simplify and automate monitoring for breaches on your network, ensuring you are able to more quickly detect and contain a breach, as well as provide the required notifications.as more organizations in healthcare are migrating data and applications to the cloud, make sure the technology you’re choosing offers advanced threat detection across both on-premises and multi-cloud environments. simplify compliance management by choosing a solution that combines an array of essential security capabilities in one platform. these may include, but are not limited to: asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, endpoint detection and response, siem event correlation, file integrity monitoring (fim), and log management. by combining these use cases in a single dashboard, you are better able to quickly identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats that target your ehr environment.intelligence it key to threat detection and incident response, so consider vendors who have in-house research teams as well as access to external threat intelligence communities and other sources that can provide insight into the latest global threats and vulnerabilities — and in particular, those that are specific to healthcare.however, intelligence without context will create lot of distracting “noise” for your team. so, check that the solution goes beyond just providing intelligence to incorporating it directly into your dashboard, including providing recommendations on how to respond to identified threats. with this intelligence and guidance at your fingertips, you can react quickly to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. and, you are assured of an always-up-to-date and optimally performing security monitoring solution.need more info on how to respond to a breach? see the hhs quick response checklist.step 5: continuously evaluate and manage riskwhether you are managing ongoing hipaa compliance internally or are using an external organization, avoid last-minute scrambling for annual evaluations and audits by employing a year-round risk management program. such a program requires having real-time visibility of your environment, including system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall information, and product upgrades.use a unified platform to gain this visibility and enable monitoring in a central location (opposed to various point solutions). here are a few examples of where a platform would be helpful for continuous risk and compliance management:examples: use automated asset discovery for on-premises and cloud environments and then create asset groups such as business critical assets or hipaa assets for ongoing monitoring, management and reporting. identify systems with known vulnerabilities and use correlation rules to detect threats.examples: monitor for successful and failed logon events to assets. monitor for communications with known malicious ip addresses or use file integrity monitoring (fim) to detect, assess and report on changes to system binaries, and content locations. schedule vulnerability scans, automate assessments, and plan for mitigation. review events and detected incidents.examples: aggregate events from across on-premises and multi-cloud environments. classify threats based on their risk level. monitor for stolen credentials, malware-based compromises such as communication to a known command and control (c&c) server, anomalous user and admin activities, file integrity, and vulnerabilities.example: automate forensics tasks to be executed in response to a detected threat and simplify forensics investigations with filters, search and reporting capabilities for event and log data. automate actions to contain threats, such as isolating systems from the network.use out-of-the box reporting to document that you’ve made an accurate assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic phi — and to quickly show the status of technical controls that align to hipaa or other regulations.maintaining adherence to hipaa is no small feat considering the dozens of criteria that are considered in the hipaa audit checklist. attempting to manage your compliance program manually and without the help of expert healthcare security consultants will not only take up massive amounts of time, it could result in your team missing an essential component of the regulation, or worse yet, enduring a breach that compromises patient data or takes down the network. however, with the right mix of people, processes and technology, it’s not an impossible to stay on top of compliance management while ensuring your network is secure and patient data protected year-round.hipaa regulationshipaa privacy rule: this rule set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by three types of covered entities: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and health care providers who conduct the standard healthcare transactions electronically.\\xa0hipaa security rule: this rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. the privacy rule is located at 45 cfr part 160 and subparts a and e of part 164\\xa0(e-phi).hipaa breach and notification rule: the hipaa breach notification rule, 45 cfr

            "{'titel': 'slack phishing attacks using webhooks', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsslack is a cloud-based messaging platform that is commonly used in workplace communications. it is feature-rich, offering additional functionality such as video calling and screen sharing in addition to a marketplace containing thousands of third-party applications and add-ons.slack incoming webhooks allow you to post messages from your applications to slack. by specifying a unique url, your message body, and a destination channel, you can send a message to any webhook that you know the url for in any workspace, regardless of membership. webhooks take the format of https://hooks.slack.com/services/t00000000/b00000000/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.generally, slack webhooks are considered a low risk integration due to the following assumptions:a deeper dive into webhooks shows that this is not entirely accurate.first, a channel override allows you to override the previously specified webhook target channel by adding the “channel” key to your json payload. if you gain access to a webhook for one channel, you can use it in others. considering sending to #general, #engineering, and other default or common channels to target a wider audience.in some cases, this can also override channel posting permissions (such as admin-only posting).slack documentation suggests that allowed target channels are based on the original creator of the webhook: “posting_to_general_channel_denied is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the \"#general\" channel for a workspace where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. you\\'ll receive this error with a http 403.” so if you can find a webhook created by an admin - congrats, you can post to admin channels!a quick search on github shows 130,989 public code results containing slack webhook urls, with a majority containing the full unique webhook value.the last assumption is true - webhooks can only accept data. that’s where we get creative.the process itself is fairly simple:as mentioned earlier, github is a good start for scraping publicly committed webhook data.first, create an app. you will also need a web server to handle the oauth flow.slack apps don’t require oauth, but in this case we will be using the slack api to access data in workspaces where the malicious app is installed. when the user attempts to install the application, they must approve the requested oauth scopes. their approval is sent to the oauth client, which retrieves an access token from the authorization server. this access token may be used to retrieve data using the specified service scopes until authorization is revoked. read more about using oauth 2.0 here.you will also need to set your oauth scope(s) to whatever data you want to exfiltrate from slack. in my case, i chose files:read in order to access files on the victim\\'s workspace.your redirect url must be set to the oauth client url.the following code snippet can be used to handle the oauth 2.0 handshake using python and flask.the following payload will send a message to the #general channel associated with the unique webhook url. in this scenario, we’re claiming that the webhook configuration needs to be updated.payload:message:the link points to https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?scope=files:read&client_id=834500968371.846020497941, which is actually the shareable url for my malicious slack app.upon clicking, the user will be directed to install “webhook configuration”.at no point is it clear that the victim has interacted with any domain except for slack.com.after exchanging the temporary authorization code for the access token, you will receive a response from slack containing the access token in addition to some other data, including identifiers for the user, team, and enterprise they are part of.distribution statistics can also be tracked from your app’s distribution page at https://api.slack.com/apps/.once you receive the user’s access token, you are free to access data on their behalf. note that slack has mostly moved to using perspectival scopes, i.e. user tokens or bot tokens that give access within the context of that entity. what you can access depends on the requester access and the scopes that your app initially requested. in my example, files:read was used.the above request allows us to list all files that the user has access to, and subsequently download each of them using the access token and the private url returned by the files.list method.the example in this post shows a simple phishing and data exfiltration flow. in theory, this could also be used for propagation of attacks across users and workspaces.the chat.postmessage method allows you to send messages via channel or direct message. with the chat:write:user permission, messages can be sent as_user using the context of the user token. compromising one member of your workspace would allow more targeted or convincing malicious messages to be sent to channels they are part of or directly to their peers, similar to the high-profile gsuite phishing attack in 2018 which was also covered by us in a previous blog post.users of shared channels can direct message users participating in the shared channels across workspaces. targeting those users would allow for compromise across multiple workspaces.application whitelistingadministrators have the option to manage their users’ slack applications. in less sensitive workspaces, this may involve only allowing apps from the app directory. applications added to the directory are required to go through slack’s own app security review process prior to approval.more sensitive environments may call for application whitelisting/application approval, requiring an administrator to review and approve applications before installation. this option is strongly recommended for companies looking to comply with ccpa, gdpr, and other regulations that require tracking of sharing of personal data with third parties.detection of suspicious oauth applicationsif whitelisting is not an option or you’d like an extra layer of defense, you may be interested in detecting suspicious slack oauth applications that users are adding to your workspace. by ingesting slack audit log data into a security analytics platform such as usm anywhere, one can alert on these suspicious actions.for example, some items of interest might include:see more on the event actions that can be monitored in slack’s official documentation.some mitigations could only be implemented by slack.implement least privilege for incoming webhookswebhooks should default to only working in the defined channel. multi-channel webhooks/overrides should be a separate application or opt-in setting. since the override feature is nested under a “setup instructions” pane that requires user interaction to display, many users are not aware of it. webhooks should not be able to post to announcement-only/admin-only channels unless that channel is explicitly defined in the webhook configuration.improved awareness of secrets handlingnone of the text on the incoming webhook configuration page asserts the importance of secure storage of the webhook url. this issue paired with the hidden “features” of incoming webhooks may lead to users assuming low-to-no risk associated with webhooks, as is supported by the frequency of webhooks publicly committed.application verificationapps that have not been reviewed by slack and are not local to the workspace should have limited functionality or require further verification. consider a process similar to the google oauth verification process, where unverified apps using high-risk scopes require additional developer identity verification and/or are capped to a certain number of users to avoid widespread abuse.webhooks are credential tools that provide access to posting functionality within a workspace.\\xa0though data cannot be exposed through webhooks on slack, we do recommend that workspace owners or admins invalidate publicly exposed webhook urls and generate new ones. to help slack admins with that diligence, we\\xa0proactively scrape github for publicly exposed webhooks and invalidate them. webhooks are safe as long as they remain secret since the webhook url itself is unguessable.\\xa0we also recommend workspace owners and admins use\\xa0these best practices\\xa0for storing credentials safely and that they review\\xa0this guide\\xa0to sending messages using incoming webhooks.we also provide additional features to support the proper oversight of app installation and usage within workspaces, which help workspace owners and admins protect their workspaces. we allow teams to require admin approvals on all apps, and recommend they establish and follow basic security diligence procedures before permitting apps to be added into a workspace. our security recommendations for approving apps can be found\\xa0here.tags: phishing, slack, webhooksinsights reportat&t cybersecurity

            "{'titel': 'security monitoring for managed cloud kubernetes', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsphoto by\\xa0chuttersnap\\xa0on\\xa0unsplashkubernetes (k8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. it has recently seen rapid adoption across enterprise environments.many environments rely on managed kubernetes services such as google kubernetes engine (gke) and amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) to take advantage of the benefits of both containerization and the cloud. google cloud platform, for example, offers advanced cluster management features such as automatic upgrades, load balancing, and stackdriver logging. amazon web services (aws) provides kubernetes(r) role based access control (rbac) integration with aws iam authenticator and logging via cloudtrail and cloudwatch.however, adoption of these cloud-managed services can introduce new challenges to your monitoring and detection capabilities, such as:the purpose of this post and associated release is to help fill in the detection gaps between kubernetes, eks, and gke, and provide normalized detection strategies that include multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.with their advanced features, cloud-managed services add potential and new attack vectors as well as room for error or confusion.kubernetes itself is highly complex; trail of bits recently published a security assessment of the kubernetes platform. the intent of the audit was to identify and document existing risks and vulnerabilities of the platform, ultimately providing recommendations to improve its security posture.the assessment team found configuration and deployment of kubernetes to be non-trivial, with certain components having “confusing default settings, missing operational controls, and implicitly defined security controls”. this presents a need to understand the vulnerabilities and limitations of the platform itself, in addition to passing a high technical barrier of entry.each managed cloud service may remediate these issues differently (or not at all). according to google, “the report also calls out kubernetes’ default settings. in gke, we’ve been actively changing these over time, including turning off abac and basic authentication by default, to make sure new clusters you create are more secure.”\\xa0 abac is attribute-based access control.insecure defaults may have inconsistent fixes between managed platforms, and new protections may not apply to earlier versions. a well-intentioned administrator may also re-enable insecure settings to restore previous functionality or compatibility.because of this, our new detections are focused not only on potential attacks but on environmental awareness with an emphasis on multi-cloud support.managed services such as amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) and google kubernetes engine (gke) use a shared responsibility model which describe the role of security of the cloud and security in the cloud (see: the gke shared responsibility model versus eks).the good news is that this model clearly defines things that aren’t your responsibility - like the underlying infrastructure, the etcd database, and control plane nodes. the bad news is that you also need to understand what you are responsible for in order to implement the proper security monitoring and controls, and this includes platform-specific implementations such as defining and protecting your security groups or iam roles.api server flags, security control defaults, and the kubernetes patch version may also be considered in their purview for new systems, while any modifications to that or continued use of legacy systems become yours. through correlation rules you are able to better track these security regressions.logs are the foundation of security monitoring and the key to understanding who is doing what on your systems. usm anywhere supports log collection for aws, gcp, and azure, which significantly expedites the collection and normalization of log data.in addition to the kubernetes control plane logs, you should also remember to monitor the associated api logs for the cloud services such as api calls to eks or gke.for cloud-managed kubernetes logging you’ll need to understand which logs you need, where to send them, and any limitations that may influence your decisions. for example, gke container logs are removed when their host pod is removed, if the log storage disk runs out of space, or when logs are periodically rotated. once exported to an external source such as stackdriver though, retention is only affected by the policy (if any) set on that platform and the events can be easily ingested into the siem.see the following tips to maximize your log coverage:gkekubernetes audit logging is integrated with cloud audit logs and stackdriver logging.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0admin activity log - contains api calls for administrative, state-changing actions on resources; enabled by default, no cost\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0data access log - contains api calls for read actions on resources and user-driven api calls on user-provided resource data; disabled by default, can be expensiveeksamazon eks integrates with cloudtrail to log eks api by calls by users, roles, or services as events. amazon eks control plane logs are delivered to cloudwatch. the control plane log streams include kubernetes api server component logs (api), audit (audit), authenticator (authenticator), controller manager (controllermanager), and scheduler (scheduler).once these logs are in place, they are ready to be ingested by your security analytics or log management platform.from here, you’d typically have to ask yourself how to monitor these logs. how does the log syntax for unauthenticated requests differ between cloudwatch and stackdriver? what interesting platform-specific api events might exist, such as association of aws iam with a kubernetes service account? fortunately, this part is already done for you in usm anywhere.we have released the following cloud kubernetes correlation rules that support both eks and gke, including:tags: cloud security, logging, kubernetes, containers, container securityinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",

            "{'titel': 'why should you use correlation rules on top of traditional signatures', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthe at&t cybersecurity alien labs team is in charge of writing correlation rules and releasing threat intelligence updates on a day-to-day basis. when researchers in the team find new malware families or threats, we always try to find the best approach to keep our customers protected. in this blog, we will look into some of the differences between signatures and correlation rules.signatures are the values (sequence of bytes, string patterns, etc.) that security products use to detect known malicious behavior. for example: snort/suricata rules, antivirus signatures and yara rules.on the other hand, correlation is the processing of the event stream in order to identify important events or patterns of events within large volumes of data. the logic to identify these events is defined in a correlation rule.to clearly see the advantages of using these correlation rules and how they usually complement traditional rules, we will look at some examples like baldr stealer, ursnif banking trojan and alpc 0-day vulnerability and how we find the best approach.example 1: malware versioningin this first example, we will cover how a malware family can evolve with time and how the behavior and configuration can change between versions. in those cases, signatures can lose their detection criteria and stop triggering alerts. a great example of this is the baldr malware that has been present since january 2019 and has presented major modifications through different versions.sophos has written a great report called baldr vs the world where you can find a lot of information about this malware and also compare the differences of version 2.x with version 3. if we analyze some of the samples to see the network connections performed to command and control server, we can easily observe the differences introduced in every version release.baldr version 1.x.xthe first discovered version of baldr was using a simple http post request with victim’s information contained in the uri. as you can see, it makes so easy to write a nids signature to detect the pattern within the network packets.baldr version 2.xin the second version, or at least in version 2.2 and above, they changed the previous request and now the communication with command and control is encrypted with a xor key. here we can see the initial beacon where xor key is always sent to the victim along with the version separated by “;” delimiter, more difficult to detect with signatures but still possible.baldr version 3.xfinally in the third version, the communication method is pretty similar to the one used in the second version and they are still using a xor key. however, they changed the delimiter by “~;~” and now they are also sending some configuration settings. these changes force us to create a new signature.knowing that, it is clear that network signatures written for version 1.x.x won’t work with versions 2.x and 3.x, the same thing happens with signatures for 2.x and 3.x. this scenario makes us think that if there were a new version, it would not be detected with the existing signatures and we will need to keep researching and creating new signatures whenever a new version of the malware is released.instead of that, we could try to observe all the actions performed by malware from the initial attack vector to the final command and control communication and correlate the events to create a detection. based on the research made into the malware family, attackers used two different methods to distribute and infect victims: crafted ace files, which exploit the winrar cve-2018-20250 vulnerability and also rtf documents targeting microsoft office products with cve-2018-0802 vulnerability.correlation rules could have helped us detect those attacks from the initial access phase and from the actions performed in victim’s systems. here is a list of possible pseudo-correlation rules:example 2: malware with many indicatorssometimes a malware family is difficult to detect because it doesn’t use http for beaconing, the communication is hidden or any other circumstances. a common approach when you can’t detect the communication is to keep track of all the malicious infrastructure to keep updating the indicators, making it very time consuming and inefficient. this is the case of ursnif malware, a banking trojan that tries to steal user information such as account credentials. if we take a look at the existing signatures for this malware, we will find a large amount of nids signatures and yara rules that tries to detect some of the indicators of compromise present in the samples.on the other hand, correlation rules can be used to detect malicious patterns in the behavior and benefit from the advantages discussed above. the following correlation rules could detect the ursnif malware without the need to update or create new signatures whenever new indicators are present.example 3: new malware or attack with no existing signaturesanother interesting scenario to demonstrate the advantages of correlation rules is when a new malware or attack begins to appear and there is no signature present to detect it. in those cases, an existing correlation rule, looking for suspicious behaviors that normally don’t happen in a system, could detect it.to explain this example we will talk about the alpc 0-day vulnerability affecting microsoft windows systems. this vulnerability was publicly released without any patch and many systems were vulnerable to it. since it was a local privilege escalation (lpe) and only a proof of concept (poc) was available, network and endpoint signatures were nonexistent and not enough to detect a possible exploitation. by doing quick research about the method used to perform the privilege escalation, the list of correlation rules that detects the threat is:we have talked about the benefits and advantages that correlation rules provide when we want to create detection methods. however, there are also some important things to take into consideration: there are no silver bullets in security, and it is better to be conservative and complement different methods and technologies to improve your detection capabilities. use regular signatures and iocs whenever you can, as they are fast to write and deploy, and have very high confidence.some of the cons of using correlations rules are:tags: alien labs, ids signatures, correlation

            "{'titel': 'alien labs 2019 analysis of threat groups molerats and apt c 37', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsin 2019, several industry analyst reports confused the threat groups molerats and apt-c-37 due to their similarity, and this has led to some confusion and inaccuracy of attribution.for example, both groups target the middle east and north africa region (with a special emphasis on palestine territories). and, they both approach victims through the use of phishing emails that contain decoy documents (mostly in arabic) and contain themes concerning the political situation in the area.to improve understanding of the differences and similarities of the two groups (as well as the links between them), we at alien labs™ are providing an analysis of their 2019 activity.a recent spear-phishing document from moleratsapt-c-37, also known as pat-bear or the syrian electronic army (sea), was first seen in october 2015 targeting members of a terrorist organization. since 2015, however, apt-c-37 has broadened their objectives to include government agencies, armed forces leadership, media organizations, political activists, and diplomats. the group mostly targets victims in western countries, with the intent of defacing their websites and social accounts while leaving a public footprint after hacking one of their victims.in previous attacks, apt-c-37 targeted windows and android systems, utilizing popular commercial remote access trojans (rats) such as droidjack, spynote, njrat, sslove, and h-worm.molerats has been present in the cybercriminal landscape since 2012. in an analysis released by the kaspersky’s great (global research & analysis team) earlier this year on the gaza hacker team and their various subgroups, kaspersky concluded that molerats is gaza cybergang “group1.” the report also concluded that molerats (i.e. cybergang group 1) operates with a lower level of sophistication than other groups within the gaza hacker team. in addition, a 2016 article in security week reported that one of molerats campaigns (october 2016) heavily used popular rats like njrat and h-worm (aka houdini).october 2019: in molerats’ october operation, the attack was distributed as a phishing campaign in the middle east. emails included a microsoft word file attachment with the title “daily report on the most important palestinian developments for the day 9-9-2019.doc” — content that spoke to the political situation in palestine. when a victim opened the attachment, the malware performed the following:diagram of molerats october 2019 campaignseptember-october 2019: in molerat’s september campaign, the malware propagated through an executable with a fake pdf file. with the names “the case of muath ismail haniyeh.pdf.exe” and “interface.pdf.exe,” the executables are both signed under the name “foxitreader.”when a victim opened the attachment, the malware performed the following:diagram of molerats\\xa0september – october 2019 campaignaugust 2019: in august, molerats ran another campaign, however we did not detect the use of phishing. instead, alien labs identified a sample communicating with a new domain that used the same c&c pattern detected by an ids signature. you can find details and more on the open threat exchange (otx). the domain, which has been up since 2017, has two malicious files associated with it:january 2019: in january, molerats switched its tactics back to phishing with word documents that concealed a malicious vbscript. the vbs contained an encoded version of the malware, which was scheduled and executed after decryption. the malicious file corresponded to a version of the fraudrop trojan, packed with enigma as previously seen in other molerats’ samples, and it used the simple and fast multimedia library (smfl), which is commonly used for game development.diagram of molerats\\xa0january 2019 campaignnovember 2019: in november, alien labs discovered a new molerats sample. in this case, the group recycled the domain used in their january attack for c&c. in this campaign, an executable with an arabic name that translates to “winter government by names,” extracted and executed a modified version of the fraudrop trojan. molerats had attempted to hide the packer they were using and they modified the filename, however the c&c and beacon they used were the same and they were using the smf library for development.diagram of molerats november 2019 campaign\\xa0\\xa0apt-c-37\\xa0moleratsnames\\xa0targetstimelines\\xa0since october

three attacks below have been attributed to apt-c-37 and molerats, however it’s our opinion at alien labs that they don’t share the clear patterns of molerats or apt-c-37 we’ve seen prior to this blog.november 2019 (palestinian election): attributed on twitter by rising enterprise security to apt-c-37this campaign tried to utilize the palestinian elections as a theme for their phishing emails, and the target appeared to be the palestinian government. we observed the use of phishing emails in the campaign with fake documents themed after the elections that contained at least two different malicious files. the file names are (translated here):both files used a microsoft word icon in attempt to make the victims run the malicious executable. when executed it performed the following.diagram of november 2019 attributed on twitter to apt-c-37august 2019: attributed on twitter to apt-c-37this attack, attributed to apt-c-37 on twitter, is very similar to the november 2019 attack described above, however it did not use the palestinian elections to lure victims. this time, the threat group used another .exe which included a decoy word document titled “a new scandal for a hamas leader”. the execution was very similar to the november 2019 campaign, however this time the camouflaged lnk file was “history.lnk” and it installed a version of houdini rat.diagram of august 2019 campaign attributed on twitter to apt-c-37april 2019: attributed on twitter to apt-c-37in april 2019, security researchers on twitter observed another phishing email with an attached executable. when executed, the malware opened a document talking about the palestinian ministers to keep the victim entertained while it installed a lnk file “msofficee.lnk,” which is very close to the real “msoffice.lnk.” the file allowed the houdini rat to execute and gain persistence on the targeted machine.diagram of april 2019 campaign attributed on twitter to apt-c-37the three attacks above have the following similar characteristics:the above-mentioned target and the delivery methods suggest these attacks are being launched by molerats (note: the houdini rat is very popular in the middle east and cannot be used for attribution). however, in the opinion of alien labs, the other attack patterns make it hard for us to tie these attacks to molerats or apt-c-37, as they do not have a clear pattern that aligns to the samples previously associated with molerats or apt-c-37. in light of this, alien labs currently buckets these three attacks under an unattributed classification.yes, indeed, we have seen similar patterns between molerats and apt-c-37 in 2019. however, molerats has shown to be a more active group (even beyond 2019), with a more advanced tradecraft and methods that are more difficult to defend against due to the use of https, high rotation of malware, or even ip filtering to specific geolocations. therefore, we do not have a high level of confidence that the latest samples belong to any of these two groups or have a relationship at this time. having said this, we offer a caveat: of the samples we analyzed, we left three unattributed for the moment. through future analysis, we may find that these do fall under either molerats or apt-c-37. if that happens, we’ll keep you updated in otx.tags: malware, malware research, alien labs, molerats,

            "{'titel': 'att alien labs analysis of an active cryptomining worm', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog post provides an overview of the at&t alien labs™ technical analysis of the common malicious implants used by threat actors targeting vulnerable exim, confluence, and weblogic servers. upon exploitation, malicious implants are deployed on the compromised machine. while most of the attacks described below are historical, we at alien labs are continuing to see new attacks, which can be further researched on the alien labs open threat exchange™ (otx).the main goal of these malicious implants thus far has been mining monero crypto-currency. below, we have included a diagram of a typical attack vector for this cryptomining worm.for our research, we analyzed the following sample (you can also see related pulses on this in otx): f00258815853f767d70897db7263f740b161c39ee50c46c26ab247afb824459a.first, the adversaries attempt exploitation. when they are successful and code execution is achieved, they then download and execute a deployment bash script from the command and control (c&c) server. this script’s main function is to act as a loader for the malicious payload. the script also has worming capabilities to infect other hosts and maintain persistence.the script uses a basic obfuscation mechanism where $_ variables are declared with string portions. these variables are then combined with others to form commands or sensible strings.we can deobfuscate it easily by using a regex.the malware distribution server is reversed and declared by the entropy variable. this seems constant amongst all the analyzed samples.the first thing the script does is check to see if the machine is already infected. if so, it kills the mining processes:it then tries to infect other machines via ssh (by reading known_hosts file and trying to connect to known hosts). this is the worming component. if a connection is successfully established, the deployment script will be executed on the remote machine:the script then downloads two things dubbed 1) seasame and 2) omelette — perhaps because omelette comes from the $egg.omelette is an elf binary and seasame is the bash deployment script that we are analyzing. one reason the script downloads again is the download can act as an update mechanism. the hashes for downloaded executables are listed below:716042b8e32cfb364b04c4e068a37a8e60c928e4fd32c894282c5d658c138684 omelettef00258815853f767d70897db7263f740b161c39ee50c46c26ab247afb824459a seasamethe download executes via wget, curl, python2 / 3 or php — in that order, depending on which one is supported in the infected system.possible eggs (implants) are shown by the installation script:the script provides for multiple implants to account for different system architectures. as of today, the supported architectures are x86, x86-64 and aarch64. for each architecture, the script provides two binaries: one statically linked and another one dynamically linked.rather than trying to select the system architecture and then download the corresponding implant, the malware authors have opted to download implants in a loop and then break the loop when the first implant sticks.persistency is achieved by adding the seasame script to a cron job. this cron job also acts as a kill prevention mechanism for the malicious payload, as it is executed every 5 minutes.if systemd is detected, a service is also created with the “cloud-agent” namenew_dog spawns a new bot and new_killbot kills all instances.characteristically it copies the bash binary to another one with a random name. it also copies curl to curlak and wget to wgetak.as reported in our otx analysis, the sample is trying to spread to other hosts by checking the known_host’s file. this is gathered from the “connects to hosts declared in the known_hosts file (usually for worm propagation)” signature found in the “dynamic analysis” tab.in the “network analysis” tab we can also observe that the sample is downloading an elf file and then a cryptocurrency miner checks in. this is what led us to believe the downloaded payload is a cryptocurrency miner.we analyzed the sample e2964214fdbfb51d5b33944cc9ca05821518a4bad01f750cee8f0d00f68a6176the sample we analyzed is one of the implants obtained directly from a c&c observed in one of the deployment scripts. particularly, this sample was obtained from http://51.15.56[.]161:162/43d.jpg.upon initial inspection the file is an elf 32-bit lsb executable for the intel 80386 architecture. although the binary is stripped, we have access to function names as the binary was coded in c++. strings are also unobfuscated, for the most part.by simple observation of the strings, it is not hard to see that this binary is a modified version of the open-source xmrig (https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) monero miner. the most important modification is in the configuration loader class for the xmrig client, which has been modified to load an obfuscated, hard-coded configuration. the rather simple obfuscation lies in the string reverse operation and hex encoding:judging by the network communications, the modified xmrig client is mining through a xmrig-proxy server, so the wallet and the mining poll addresses are not directly accessible without access to the proxy server. below is a screenshot from the pcap obtained after executing the malicious implant in our sandbox:through additional research on otx, alien labs determined that we are dealing with a cryptocurrency miner. first, we can observe the “cryptocurrency miner checkin” rule being triggered in the “network analysis” tab. we can also observe that the sample is using hard-coded ip addresses rather than domain names as the “communicates with host for which no dns query was performed” signature is triggered in the “dynamic analysis” tab.the extraction of the c&c / proxy addresses can be automated through the use of a yara rule to match the configuration loader and a python script to de-reference the virtual address. as the malicious actors are using a proxy server, we will not be able to extract the wallet address nor the mining pool through this method. also, it is important to note that this method will not work in packed binaries.executing such a script through the gathered 100+ samples during the hunting phase yields the following unique command & control addresses:the yara rule used for this task can be found in the “indicators of compromise” section below.we first discovered indicators of compromise from this campaign in early june 2019, and ever since we have been tracking the activity of this threat actor. at the time of writing this report, the threat actor is still active and their infrastructure is still up.while not being a very big campaign, this individual or group has managed to go under the radar for some months, without drawing much attention.it is hard to estimate how much income this campaign has reported to the threat actor, as the miner is configured to mine through a proxy, and thus conceals the receiving wallet address.in otx and usm we have created multiple detection rules to help detect and block this threat.given the uniqueness of this script we can do a vt retrohunt to get similar scripts with the following yara rule:we can do a yara rule for the modifications found in the xmrig client as well:observed unique c&c uris:for more indicators of compromise, please see the otx pulse.tags: malware research, malware hunting, yara, bash, exim, python, confluence, weblogic,

            "{'titel': 'a hipaa compliance checklist', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsmaintaining security and compliance with hipaa, the health insurance portability and accountability act, is growing ever more challenging. the networks that house protected health information (phi or ephi) are becoming larger and more complex — especially as organizations move data to the cloud. at the same time, security professionals are faced with an evolving threat landscape of increasingly sophisticated threat actors and methods of attack.for example, 2018 threat intelligence research by at&t alien\\xa0labs reports a rise in the number of targeted ransomware attacks in the healthcare sector. these attacks are often backed by organized criminals who see opportunities for making money from health care providers and other similar entities who must protect and keep assets, systems, and networks continuously operating.one such criminal group operating the samsam ransomware is thought to have earned more than $5 million dollars by manually compromising critical healthcare networks. and, according to alienvault labs, the methods used by samsam are more akin to a targeted attack than typical opportunistic ransomware.to help address these security challenges and ensure adherence to compliance mandates, security and it professionals should consider how people, processes, and technology can be used together to create a holistic it security compliance program that simplifies preparation, auditing and reporting, as well as ongoing security risk management and breach monitoring and response. here’s a five-step hipaa compliance checklist to get started.certification and ongoing hipaa compliancehipaa sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. any entity that deals with protected health information must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. in 2009, the health information technology for economic and clinical health (hitech) act was adopted to promote the “meaningful use of health information technology” and address the privacy and security concerns associated with the electronic transmission of health information. although there is no standard or implementation specification that requires a covered entity to “certify” compliance, the evaluation standard § 164.308(a)(8) requires covered entities to perform ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations that establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements. evaluations can be performed and documented internally or by an external organization that provides evaluation or “certification” services. however, hitech requires the hhs office for civil rights (ocr) to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates for compliance with the hipaa privacy, security, and breach notification rules.step 1: start with a comprehensive risk assessment and gap analysisyour compliance strategy should start with a solid foundation, which is why the first step in your journey to hipaa compliance should be a readiness assessment that includes a comprehensive risk and compliance analysis of your electronic health record (ehr) environment. this assessment is often best done by a third party with expertise in healthcare security and compliance, as hipaa regulations can be confusing and cumbersome. using a third party with the necessary expertise will ensure you don’t miss or misunderstand the required regulations, and it will save you time as they will likely have a hipaa checklist to reference.\\xa0your consultant can perform an initial evaluation of your entire security program to determine its adherence to hipaa regulations and the level of readiness to proceed with the “certification” process. it’s worth noting that the ocr does not actually “certify” hipaa compliance (see side bar), however there are organizations outside of the ocr that do provide “certification” services, and many organizations take advantage of these certification services to prove compliance. as a result of the evaluation, your consultant should provide a comprehensive report that may include such things as:according to the ocr, organizations that have aligned their security programs to the national institute for standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework may find it helpful as a starting place to identify potential gaps in their compliance with the hipaa security rule. addressing these gaps can bolster compliance with the security rule and improve the organization’s ability to secure ephi and other critical information and business processes. read how nist “maps” to the hipaa security rule in the hipaa security rule crosswalk to nist cybersecurity framework.step 2: remediate identified risks and address compliance gapsonce you’ve identified your organization’s risks, take immediate steps to address the gaps within your security program. again, a consultant who has practical experience in healthcare security will be very useful in providing strategic guidance, as well as advice on risk mitigation. many organizations use the same consultant who performed their initial risk assessment.your consultant may develop specific programs, policies, standards, and procedures, as well as support or help implement key security practices and controls. for example, they may assist in prioritizing vulnerabilities and make recommendations for remediation in your ehr environment. or, they may provide pre-packaged employee security awareness training that meets hipaa guidelines, such as educating employees on security risks and running them through attack scenarios.make use of security technology to help you more quickly address the gaps in your compliance program — and consider platforms versus point solutions, giving you the ability to address multiple issues at once. also, look for solutions that address both on-premises and multi-cloud environments as hipaa regulations apply to both (see guidance on hipaa & cloud computing).\\xa0for example, look for such use cases as the automation of asset discovery and the ability to categorize those assets into hipaa groups for easy management and reporting. those same solutions may also perform vulnerability assessments, automate the prioritization of vulnerabilities for mitigation, and integrate with ticketing solutions to ensure the most critical are being remediated while overall risks are mitigated.step 3: take advantage of automated compliance reportingthe evaluation standard of hipaa requires covered entities to perform and document ongoing technical and non-technical evaluations to establish the extent to which their security policies and procedures meet the security requirements.most solutions do not cover all the requirements defined by the hipaa audit protocol, but they will give you a jump on your hipaa checklist.many security management platforms also include additional predefined event reports, such as reports by data source and data source type, helping to make daily compliance monitoring and reporting activities more efficient.also, look for an intuitive and flexible interface that allows you to quickly search and analyze your security data, as well as the ability to create and save custom views and export them as executive-ready reports.finally, solutions that provide centralized visibility of your cloud and on-premises assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and log data from firewalls and other security tools are key to giving you the most complete and contextual data set for maintaining and documenting continuous compliance.step 4: implement monitoring and breach notification protocolsthe breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and business associates to provide notifications if they experience a breach that involves unsecured protected health information.security management platforms can help to simplify and automate monitoring for breaches on your network, ensuring you are able to more quickly detect and contain a breach, as well as provide the required notifications.as more organizations in healthcare are migrating data and applications to the cloud, make sure the technology you’re choosing offers advanced threat detection across both on-premises and multi-cloud environments. simplify compliance management by choosing a solution that combines an array of essential security capabilities in one platform. these may include, but are not limited to: asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, intrusion detection, behavioral monitoring, endpoint detection and response, siem event correlation, file integrity monitoring (fim), and log management. by combining these use cases in a single dashboard, you are better able to quickly identify, analyze, and respond to emerging threats that target your ehr environment.intelligence it key to threat detection and incident response, so consider vendors who have in-house research teams as well as access to external threat intelligence communities and other sources that can provide insight into the latest global threats and vulnerabilities — and in particular, those that are specific to healthcare.however, intelligence without context will create lot of distracting “noise” for your team. so, check that the solution goes beyond just providing intelligence to incorporating it directly into your dashboard, including providing recommendations on how to respond to identified threats. with this intelligence and guidance at your fingertips, you can react quickly to the latest tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors. and, you are assured of an always-up-to-date and optimally performing security monitoring solution.need more info on how to respond to a breach? see the hhs quick response checklist.step 5: continuously evaluate and manage riskwhether you are managing ongoing hipaa compliance internally or are using an external organization, avoid last-minute scrambling for annual evaluations and audits by employing a year-round risk management program. such a program requires having real-time visibility of your environment, including system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall information, and product upgrades.use a unified platform to gain this visibility and enable monitoring in a central location (opposed to various point solutions). here are a few examples of where a platform would be helpful for continuous risk and compliance management:examples: use automated asset discovery for on-premises and cloud environments and then create asset groups such as business critical assets or hipaa assets for ongoing monitoring, management and reporting. identify systems with known vulnerabilities and use correlation rules to detect threats.examples: monitor for successful and failed logon events to assets. monitor for communications with known malicious ip addresses or use file integrity monitoring (fim) to detect, assess and report on changes to system binaries, and content locations. schedule vulnerability scans, automate assessments, and plan for mitigation. review events and detected incidents.examples: aggregate events from across on-premises and multi-cloud environments. classify threats based on their risk level. monitor for stolen credentials, malware-based compromises such as communication to a known command and control (c&c) server, anomalous user and admin activities, file integrity, and vulnerabilities.example: automate forensics tasks to be executed in response to a detected threat and simplify forensics investigations with filters, search and reporting capabilities for event and log data. automate actions to contain threats, such as isolating systems from the network.use out-of-the box reporting to document that you’ve made an accurate assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all electronic phi — and to quickly show the status of technical controls that align to hipaa or other regulations.maintaining adherence to hipaa is no small feat considering the dozens of criteria that are considered in the hipaa audit checklist. attempting to manage your compliance program manually and without the help of expert healthcare security consultants will not only take up massive amounts of time, it could result in your team missing an essential component of the regulation, or worse yet, enduring a breach that compromises patient data or takes down the network. however, with the right mix of people, processes and technology, it’s not an impossible to stay on top of compliance management while ensuring your network is secure and patient data protected year-round.hipaa regulationshipaa privacy rule: this rule set national standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by three types of covered entities: health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and health care providers who conduct the standard healthcare transactions electronically.\\xa0hipaa security rule: this rule sets national standards for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. the privacy rule is located at 45 cfr part 160 and subparts a and e of part 164\\xa0(e-phi).hipaa breach and notification rule: the hipaa breach notification rule, 45 cfr §§ 164.400-414, requires hipaa covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information.tags: ransomware, risk management,

            "{'titel': 'slack phishing attacks using webhooks', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsslack is a cloud-based messaging platform that is commonly used in workplace communications. it is feature-rich, offering additional functionality such as video calling and screen sharing in addition to a marketplace containing thousands of third-party applications and add-ons.slack incoming webhooks allow you to post messages from your applications to slack. by specifying a unique url, your message body, and a destination channel, you can send a message to any webhook that you know the url for in any workspace, regardless of membership. webhooks take the format of https://hooks.slack.com/services/t00000000/b00000000/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.generally, slack webhooks are considered a low risk integration due to the following assumptions:a deeper dive into webhooks shows that this is not entirely accurate.first, a channel override allows you to override the previously specified webhook target channel by adding the “channel” key to your json payload. if you gain access to a webhook for one channel, you can use it in others. considering sending to #general, #engineering, and other default or common channels to target a wider audience.in some cases, this can also override channel posting permissions (such as admin-only posting).slack documentation suggests that allowed target channels are based on the original creator of the webhook: “posting_to_general_channel_denied is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the \"#general\" channel for a workspace where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. you\\'ll receive this error with a http 403.” so if you can find a webhook created by an admin - congrats, you can post to admin channels!a quick search on github shows 130,989 public code results containing slack webhook urls, with a majority containing the full unique webhook value.the last assumption is true - webhooks can only accept data. that’s where we get creative.the process itself is fairly simple:as mentioned earlier, github is a good start for scraping publicly committed webhook data.first, create an app. you will also need a web server to handle the oauth flow.slack apps don’t require oauth, but in this case we will be using the slack api to access data in workspaces where the malicious app is installed. when the user attempts to install the application, they must approve the requested oauth scopes. their approval is sent to the oauth client, which retrieves an access token from the authorization server. this access token may be used to retrieve data using the specified service scopes until authorization is revoked. read more about using oauth 2.0 here.you will also need to set your oauth scope(s) to whatever data you want to exfiltrate from slack. in my case, i chose files:read in order to access files on the victim\\'s workspace.your redirect url must be set to the oauth client url.the following code snippet can be used to handle the oauth 2.0 handshake using python and flask.the following payload will send a message to the #general channel associated with the unique webhook url. in this scenario, we’re claiming that the webhook configuration needs to be updated.payload:message:the link points to https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?scope=files:read&client_id=834500968371.846020497941, which is actually the shareable url for my malicious slack app.upon clicking, the user will be directed to install “webhook configuration”.at no point is it clear that the victim has interacted with any domain except for slack.com.after exchanging the temporary authorization code for the access token, you will receive a response from slack containing the access token in addition to some other data, including identifiers for the user, team, and enterprise they are part of.distribution statistics can also be tracked from your app’s distribution page at https://api.slack.com/apps/.once you receive the user’s access token, you are free to access data on their behalf. note that slack has mostly moved to using perspectival scopes, i.e. user tokens or bot tokens that give access within the context of that entity. what you can access depends on the requester access and the scopes that your app initially requested. in my example, files:read was used.the above request allows us to list all files that the user has access to, and subsequently download each of them using the access token and the private url returned by the files.list method.the example in this post shows a simple phishing and data exfiltration flow. in theory, this could also be used for propagation of attacks across users and workspaces.the chat.postmessage method allows you to send messages via channel or direct message. with the chat:write:user permission, messages can be sent as_user using the context of the user token. compromising one member of your workspace would allow more targeted or convincing malicious messages to be sent to channels they are part of or directly to their peers, similar to the high-profile gsuite phishing attack in 2018 which was also covered by us in a previous blog post.users of shared channels can direct message users participating in the shared channels across workspaces. targeting those users would allow for compromise across multiple workspaces.application whitelistingadministrators have the option to manage their users’ slack applications. in less sensitive workspaces, this may involve only allowing apps from the app directory. applications added to the directory are required to go through slack’s own app security review process prior to approval.more sensitive environments may call for application whitelisting/application approval, requiring an administrator to review and approve applications before installation. this option is strongly recommended for companies looking to comply with ccpa, gdpr, and other regulations that require tracking of sharing of personal data with third parties.detection of suspicious oauth applicationsif whitelisting is not an option or you’d like an extra layer of defense, you may be interested in detecting suspicious slack oauth applications that users are adding to your workspace. by ingesting slack audit log data into a security analytics platform such as usm anywhere, one can alert on these suspicious actions.for example, some items of interest might include:see more on the event actions that can be monitored in slack’s official documentation.some mitigations could only be implemented by slack.implement least privilege for incoming webhookswebhooks should default to only working in the defined channel. multi-channel webhooks/overrides should be a separate application or opt-in setting. since the override feature is nested under a “setup instructions” pane that requires user interaction to display, many users are not aware of it. webhooks should not be able to post to announcement-only/admin-only channels unless that channel is explicitly defined in the webhook configuration.improved awareness of secrets handlingnone of the text on the incoming webhook configuration page asserts the importance of secure storage of the webhook url. this issue paired with the hidden “features” of incoming webhooks may lead to users assuming low-to-no risk associated with webhooks, as is supported by the frequency of webhooks publicly committed.application verificationapps that have not been reviewed by slack and are not local to the workspace should have limited functionality or require further verification. consider a process similar to the google oauth verification process, where unverified apps using high-risk scopes require additional developer identity verification and/or are capped to a certain number of users to avoid widespread abuse.webhooks are credential tools that provide access to posting functionality within a workspace.\\xa0though data cannot be exposed through webhooks on slack, we do recommend that workspace owners

            "{'titel': 'security monitoring for managed cloud kubernetes', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsphoto by\\xa0chuttersnap\\xa0on\\xa0unsplashkubernetes (k8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. it has recently seen rapid adoption across enterprise environments.many environments rely on managed kubernetes services such as google kubernetes engine (gke) and amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) to take advantage of the benefits of both containerization and the cloud. google cloud platform, for example, offers advanced cluster management features such as automatic upgrades, load balancing, and stackdriver logging. amazon web services (aws) provides kubernetes(r) role based access control (rbac) integration with aws iam authenticator and logging via cloudtrail and cloudwatch.however, adoption of these cloud-managed services can introduce new challenges to your monitoring and detection capabilities, such as:the purpose of this post and associated release is to help fill in the detection gaps between kubernetes, eks, and gke, and provide normalized detection strategies that include multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.with their advanced features, cloud-managed services add potential and new attack vectors as well as room for error or confusion.kubernetes itself is highly complex; trail of bits recently published a security assessment of the kubernetes platform. the intent of the audit was to identify and document existing risks and vulnerabilities of the platform, ultimately providing recommendations to improve its security posture.the assessment team found configuration and deployment of kubernetes to be non-trivial, with certain components having “confusing default settings, missing operational controls, and implicitly defined security controls”. this presents a need to understand the vulnerabilities and limitations of the platform itself, in addition to passing a high technical barrier of entry.each managed cloud service may remediate these issues differently (or not at all). according to google, “the report also calls out kubernetes’ default settings. in gke, we’ve been actively changing these over time, including turning off abac and basic authentication by default, to make sure new clusters you create are more secure.”\\xa0 abac is attribute-based access control.insecure defaults may have inconsistent fixes between managed platforms, and new protections may not apply to earlier versions. a well-intentioned administrator may also re-enable insecure settings to restore previous functionality or compatibility.because of this, our new detections are focused not only on potential attacks but on environmental awareness with an emphasis on multi-cloud support.managed services such as amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) and google kubernetes engine (gke) use a shared responsibility model which describe the role of security of the cloud and security in the cloud (see: the gke shared responsibility model versus eks).the good news is that this model clearly defines things that aren’t your responsibility - like the underlying infrastructure, the etcd database, and control plane nodes. the bad news is that you also need to understand what you are responsible for in order to implement the proper security monitoring and controls, and this includes platform-specific implementations such as defining and protecting your security groups or iam roles.api server flags, security control defaults, and the kubernetes patch version may also be considered in their purview for new systems, while any modifications to that or continued use of legacy systems become yours. through correlation rules you are able to better track these security regressions.logs are the foundation of security monitoring and the key to understanding who is doing what on your systems. usm anywhere supports log collection for aws, gcp, and azure, which significantly expedites the collection and normalization of log data.in addition to the kubernetes control plane logs, you should also remember to monitor the associated api logs for the cloud services such as api calls to eks or gke.for cloud-managed kubernetes logging you’ll need to understand which logs you need, where to send them, and any limitations that may influence your decisions. for example, gke container logs are removed when their host pod is removed, if the log storage disk runs out of space, or when logs are periodically rotated. once exported to an external source such as stackdriver though, retention is only affected by the policy (if any) set on that platform and the events can be easily ingested into the siem.see the following tips to maximize your log coverage:gkekubernetes audit logging is integrated with cloud audit logs and stackdriver logging.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0admin activity log - contains api calls for administrative, state-changing actions on resources; enabled by default, no cost\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0data access log - contains api calls for read actions on resources and user-driven api calls on user-provided resource data; disabled by default, can be expensiveeksamazon eks integrates with cloudtrail to log eks api by calls by users, roles, or services as events. amazon eks control plane logs are delivered to cloudwatch. the control plane log streams include kubernetes api server component logs (api), audit (audit), authenticator (authenticator), controller manager (controllermanager), and scheduler (scheduler).once these logs are in place, they are ready to be ingested by your security analytics or log management platform.from here, you’d typically have to ask yourself how to monitor these logs. how does the log syntax for unauthenticated requests differ between cloudwatch and stackdriver? what interesting platform-specific api events might exist, such as association of aws iam with a kubernetes service account? fortunately, this part is already done for you in usm anywhere.we have released the following cloud kubernetes correlation rules that support both eks and gke, including:tags: cloud security, logging, kubernetes, containers, container securityinsights reportat&t cybersecurity insights™ report 2023:\\nedge ecosystemself assessmentbenchmark your cybersecurity maturity© copyright 2023we use cookies to provide you with a great user experience. by using our website, you agree to our privacy policy and website terms of use.'}\n",

            "{'titel': 'why should you use correlation rules on top of traditional signatures', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthe at&t cybersecurity alien labs team is in charge of writing correlation rules and releasing threat intelligence updates on a day-to-day basis. when researchers in the team find new malware families or threats, we always try to find the best approach to keep our customers protected. in this blog, we will look into some of the differences between signatures and correlation rules.signatures are the values (sequence of bytes, string patterns, etc.) that security products use to detect known malicious behavior. for example: snort/suricata rules, antivirus signatures and yara rules.on the other hand, correlation is the processing of the event stream in order to identify important events or patterns of events within large volumes of data. the logic to identify these events is defined in a correlation rule.to clearly see the advantages of using these correlation rules and how they usually complement traditional rules, we will look at some examples like baldr stealer, ursnif banking trojan and alpc 0-day vulnerability and how we find the best approach.example 1: malware versioningin this first example, we will cover how a malware family can evolve with time and how the behavior and configuration can change between versions. in those cases, signatures can lose their detection criteria and stop triggering alerts. a great example of this is the baldr malware that has been present since january 2019 and has presented major modifications through different versions.sophos has written a great report called baldr vs the world where you can find a lot of information about this malware and also compare the differences of version 2.x with version 3. if we analyze some of the samples to see the network connections performed to command and control server, we can easily observe the differences introduced in every version release.baldr version 1.x.xthe first discovered version of baldr was using a simple http post request with victim’s information contained in the uri. as you can see, it makes so easy to write a nids signature to detect the pattern within the network packets.baldr version 2.xin the second version, or at least in version 2.2 and above, they changed the previous request and now the communication with command and control is encrypted with a xor key. here we can see the initial beacon where xor key is always sent to the victim along with the version separated by “;” delimiter, more difficult to detect with signatures but still possible.baldr version 3.xfinally in the third version, the communication method is pretty similar to the one used in the second version and they are still using a xor key. however, they changed the delimiter by “~;~” and now they are also sending some configuration settings. these changes force us to create a new signature.knowing that, it is clear that network signatures written for version 1.x.x won’t work with versions 2.x and 3.x, the same thing happens with signatures for 2.x and 3.x. this scenario makes us think that if there were a new version, it would not be detected with the existing signatures and we will need to keep researching and creating new signatures whenever a new version of the malware is released.instead of that, we could try to observe all the actions performed by malware from the initial attack vector to the final command and control communication and correlate the events to create a detection. based on the research made into the malware family, attackers used two different methods to distribute and infect victims: crafted ace files, which exploit the winrar cve-2018-20250 vulnerability and also rtf documents targeting microsoft office products with cve-2018-0802 vulnerability.correlation rules could have helped us detect those attacks from the initial access phase and from the actions performed in victim’s systems. here is a list of possible pseudo-correlation rules:example 2: malware with many indicatorssometimes a malware family is difficult to detect because it doesn’t use http for beaconing, the communication is hidden or any other circumstances. a common approach when you can’t detect the communication is to keep track of all the malicious infrastructure to keep updating the indicators, making it very time consuming and inefficient. this is the case of ursnif malware, a banking trojan that tries to steal user information such as account credentials. if we take a look at the existing signatures for this malware, we will find a large amount of nids signatures and yara rules that tries to detect some of the indicators of compromise present in the samples.on the other hand, correlation rules can be used to detect malicious patterns in the behavior and benefit from the advantages discussed above. the following correlation rules could detect the ursnif malware without the need to update or create new signatures whenever new indicators are present.example 3: new malware or attack with no existing signaturesanother interesting scenario to demonstrate the advantages of correlation rules is when a new malware or attack begins to appear and there is no signature present to detect it. in those cases, an existing correlation rule, looking for suspicious behaviors that normally don’t happen in a system, could detect it.to explain this example we will talk about the alpc 0-day vulnerability affecting microsoft windows systems. this vulnerability was publicly released without any patch and many systems were vulnerable to it. since it was a local privilege escalation (lpe) and only a proof of concept (poc) was available, network and endpoint signatures were nonexistent and not enough to detect a possible exploitation. by doing quick research about the method used to perform the privilege escalation, the list of correlation rules that detects the threat is:we have talked about the benefits and advantages that correlation rules provide when we want to create detection methods. however, there are also some important things to take into consideration: there are no silver bullets in security, and it is better to be conservative and complement different methods and technologies to improve your detection capabilities. use regular signatures and iocs whenever you can, as they are fast to write and deploy, and have very high confidence.some of the cons of using correlations rules are:tags: alien labs, ids signatures, correlation

            "{'titel': 'alien labs 2019 analysis of threat groups molerats and apt c 37', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsin 2019, several industry analyst reports confused the threat groups molerats and apt-c-37 due to their similarity, and this has led to some confusion and inaccuracy of attribution.for example, both groups target the middle east and north africa region (with a special emphasis on palestine territories). and, they both approach victims through the use of phishing emails that contain decoy documents (mostly in arabic) and contain themes concerning the political situation in the area.to improve understanding of the differences and similarities of the two groups (as well as the links between them), we at alien labs™ are providing an analysis of their 2019 activity.a recent spear-phishing document from moleratsapt-c-37, also known as pat-bear or the syrian electronic army (sea), was first seen in october 2015 targeting members of a terrorist organization. since 2015, however, apt-c-37 has broadened their objectives to include government agencies, armed forces leadership, media organizations, political activists, and diplomats. the group mostly targets victims in western countries, with the intent of defacing their websites and social accounts while leaving a public footprint after hacking one of their victims.in previous attacks, apt-c-37 targeted windows and android systems, utilizing popular commercial remote access trojans (rats) such as droidjack, spynote, njrat, sslove, and h-worm.molerats has been present in the cybercriminal landscape since 2012. in an analysis released by the kaspersky’s great (global research & analysis team) earlier this year on the gaza hacker team and their various subgroups, kaspersky concluded that molerats is gaza cybergang “group1.” the report also concluded that molerats (i.e. cybergang group 1) operates with a lower level of sophistication than other groups within the gaza hacker team. in addition, a 2016 article in security week reported that one of molerats campaigns (october 2016) heavily used popular rats like njrat and h-worm (aka houdini).october 2019: in molerats’ october operation, the attack was distributed as a phishing campaign in the middle east. emails included a microsoft word file attachment with the title “daily report on the most important palestinian developments for the day 9-9-2019.doc” — content that spoke to the political situation in palestine. when a victim opened the attachment, the malware performed the following:diagram of molerats october 2019 campaignseptember-october 2019: in molerat’s september campaign, the malware propagated through an executable with a fake pdf file. with the names “the case of muath ismail

molerats\\xa0september – october 2019 campaignaugust 2019: in august, molerats ran another campaign, however we did not detect the use of phishing. instead, alien labs identified a sample communicating with a new domain that used the same c&c pattern detected by an ids signature. you can find details and more on the open threat exchange (otx). the domain, which has been up since 2017, has two malicious files associated with it:january 2019: in january, molerats switched its tactics back to phishing with word documents that concealed a malicious vbscript. the vbs contained an encoded version of the malware, which was scheduled and executed after decryption. the malicious file corresponded to a version of the fraudrop trojan, packed with enigma as previously seen in other molerats’ samples, and it used the simple and fast multimedia library (smfl), which is commonly used for game development.diagram of molerats\\xa0january 2019 campaignnovember 2019: in november, alien labs discovered a new molerats sample. in this case, the group recycled the domain used in their january attack for c&c. in this campaign, an executable with an arabic name that translates to “winter government by names,” extracted and executed a modified version of the fraudrop trojan. molerats had attempted to hide the packer they were using and they modified the filename, however the c&c and beacon they used were the same and they were using the smf library for development.diagram of molerats november 2019 campaign\\xa0\\xa0apt-c-37\\xa0moleratsnames\\xa0targetstimelines\\xa0since october

three attacks below have been attributed to apt-c-37 and molerats, however it’s our opinion at alien labs that they don’t share the clear patterns of molerats or apt-c-37 we’ve seen prior to this blog.november 2019 (palestinian election): attributed on twitter by rising enterprise security to apt-c-37this campaign tried to utilize the palestinian elections as a theme for their phishing emails, and the target appeared to be the palestinian government. we observed the use of phishing emails in the campaign with fake documents themed after the elections that contained at least two different malicious files. the file names are (translated here):both files used a microsoft word icon in attempt to make the victims run the malicious executable. when executed it performed the following.diagram of november 2019 attributed on twitter to apt-c-37august 2019: attributed on twitter to apt-c-37this attack, attributed to apt-c-37 on twitter, is very similar to the november 2019 attack described above, however it did not use the palestinian elections to lure victims. this time, the threat group used another .exe which included a decoy word document titled “a new scandal for a hamas leader”. the execution was very similar to the november 2019 campaign, however this time the camouflaged lnk file was “history.lnk” and it installed a version of houdini rat.diagram of august 2019 campaign attributed on twitter to apt-c-37april 2019: attributed on twitter to apt-c-37in april 2019, security researchers on twitter observed another phishing email with an attached executable. when executed, the malware opened a document talking about the palestinian ministers to keep the victim entertained while it installed a lnk file “msofficee.lnk,” which is very close to the real “msoffice.lnk.” the file allowed the houdini rat to execute and gain persistence on the targeted machine.diagram of april 2019 campaign attributed on twitter to apt-c-37the three attacks above have the following similar characteristics:the above-mentioned target and the delivery methods suggest these attacks are being launched by molerats (note: the houdini rat is very popular in the middle east and cannot be used for attribution). however, in the opinion of alien labs, the other attack patterns make it hard for us to tie these attacks to molerats or apt-c-37, as they do not have a clear pattern that aligns to the samples previously associated with molerats or apt-c-37. in light of this, alien labs currently buckets these three attacks under an unattributed classification.yes, indeed, we have seen similar patterns between molerats and apt-c-37 in 2019. however, molerats has shown to be a more active group (even beyond 2019), with a more advanced tradecraft and methods that are more difficult to defend against due to the use of https, high rotation of malware, or even ip filtering to specific geolocations. therefore, we do not have a high level of confidence that the latest samples belong to any of these two groups or have a relationship at this time. having said this, we offer a caveat: of the samples we analyzed, we left three unattributed for the moment. through future analysis, we may find that these do fall under either molerats or apt-c-37. if that happens, we’ll keep you updated in otx.tags: malware, malware research, alien labs, molerats,

following sample (you can also see related pulses on this in otx): f00258815853f767d70897db7263f740b161c39ee50c46c26ab247afb824459a.first, the adversaries attempt exploitation. when they are successful and code execution is achieved, they then download and execute a deployment bash script from the command and control (c&c) server. this script’s main function is to act as a loader for the malicious payload. the script also has worming capabilities to infect other hosts and maintain persistence.the script uses a basic obfuscation mechanism where $_ variables are declared with string portions. these variables are then combined with others to form commands or sensible strings.we can deobfuscate it easily by using a regex.the malware distribution server is reversed and declared by the entropy variable. this seems constant amongst all the analyzed samples.the first thing the script does is check to see if the machine is already infected. if so, it kills the mining processes:it then tries to infect other machines via ssh (by reading known_hosts file and trying to connect to known hosts). this is the worming component. if a connection is successfully established, the deployment script will be executed on the remote machine:the script then downloads two things dubbed 1) seasame and 2) omelette — perhaps because omelette comes from the $egg.omelette is an elf binary and seasame is the bash deployment script that we are analyzing. one reason the script downloads again is the download can act as an update mechanism. the hashes for downloaded executables are listed below:716042b8e32cfb364b04c4e068a37a8e60c928e4fd32c894282c5d658c138684 omelettef00258815853f767d70897db7263f740b161c39ee50c46c26ab247afb824459a seasamethe download executes via wget, curl, python2 / 3 or php — in that order, depending on which one is supported in the infected system.possible eggs (implants) are shown by the installation script:the script provides for multiple implants to account for different system architectures. as of today, the supported architectures are x86, x86-64 and aarch64. for each architecture, the script provides two binaries: one statically linked and another one dynamically linked.rather than trying to select the system architecture and then download the corresponding implant, the malware authors have opted to download implants in a loop and then break the loop when the first implant sticks.persistency is achieved by adding the seasame script to a cron job. this cron job also acts as a kill prevention mechanism for the malicious payload, as it is executed every 5 minutes.if systemd is detected, a service is also created with the “cloud-agent” namenew_dog spawns a new bot and new_killbot kills all instances.characteristically it copies the bash binary to another one with a random name. it also copies curl to curlak and wget to wgetak.as reported in our otx analysis, the sample is trying to spread to other hosts by checking the known_host’s file. this is gathered from the “connects to hosts declared in the known_hosts file (usually for worm propagation)” signature found in the “dynamic analysis” tab.in the “network analysis” tab we can also observe that the sample is downloading an elf file and then a cryptocurrency miner checks in. this is what led us to believe the downloaded payload is a cryptocurrency miner.we analyzed the sample e2964214fdbfb51d5b33944cc9ca05821518a4bad01f750cee8f0d00f68a6176the sample we analyzed is one of the implants obtained directly from a c&c observed in one of the deployment scripts. particularly, this sample was obtained from http://51.15.56[.]161:162/43d.jpg.upon initial inspection the file is an elf 32-bit lsb executable for the intel 80386 architecture. although the binary is stripped, we have access to function names as the binary was coded in c++. strings are also unobfuscated, for the most part.by simple observation of the strings, it is not hard to see that this binary is a modified version of the open-source xmrig (https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) monero miner. the most important modification is in the configuration loader class for the xmrig client, which has been modified to load an obfuscated, hard-coded configuration. the rather simple obfuscation lies in the string reverse operation and hex encoding:judging by the network communications, the modified xmrig client is mining through a xmrig-proxy server, so the wallet and the mining poll addresses are not directly accessible without access to the proxy server. below is a screenshot from the pcap obtained after executing the malicious implant in our sandbox:through additional research on otx, alien labs determined that we are dealing with a cryptocurrency miner. first, we can observe the “cryptocurrency miner checkin” rule being triggered in the “network analysis” tab. we can also observe that the sample is using hard-coded ip addresses rather than domain names as the “communicates with host for which no dns query was performed” signature is triggered in the “dynamic analysis” tab.the extraction of the c&c / proxy addresses can be automated through the use of a yara rule to match the configuration loader and a python script to de-reference the virtual address. as the malicious actors are using a proxy server, we will not be able to extract the wallet address nor the mining pool through this method. also, it is important to note that this method will not work in packed binaries.executing such a script through the gathered 100+ samples during the hunting phase yields the following unique command & control addresses:the yara rule used for this task can be found in the “indicators of compromise” section below.we first discovered indicators of compromise from this campaign in early june 2019, and ever since we have been tracking the activity of this threat actor. at the time of writing this report, the threat actor is still active and their infrastructure is still up.while not being a very big campaign, this individual or group has managed to go under the radar for some months, without drawing much attention.it is hard to estimate how much income this campaign has reported to the threat actor, as the miner is configured to mine through a proxy, and thus conceals the receiving wallet address.in otx and usm we have created multiple detection rules to help detect and block this threat.given the uniqueness of this script we can do a vt retrohunt to get similar scripts with the following yara rule:we can do a yara rule for the modifications found in the xmrig client as well:observed unique c&c uris:for more indicators of compromise, please see the otx pulse.tags: malware research, malware hunting, yara, bash, exim, python, confluence, weblogic,

            "{'titel': 'google cloud platform security monitoring with usm anywhere', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsaccording to a 2019 cyber security report published by the international information system security certification consortium, 93 percent of organizations say they are concerned about cloud security and 28 percent admit to having experienced cloud security incidents during the past year.the reality is, most companies lack the specialized knowledge and skills needed to provide that customer data stored in the cloud is protected cloud service providers (csps) do provide extra security layers, such as automating threat detection, with the intent of making their customers feel more confident in the security of the cloud. however, the number of cloud breaches that are being reported shows that csps and organizations alike continue to struggle with cloud security. much of this is due to a lack of unified visibility not just in the cloud, but across an organization’s entire network, siloed teams and technologies, lack of threat intelligence, and partnerships with third-parties whose security controls are not up to snuff.to address these challenges, many in the industry are advocating for organizations to simplify and unify their security approach, i.e. bring as many controls as possible into a single solution in order to break down the silos between security teams and technologies and to give greater visibility across the organization. we at at&t cybersecurity help organizations to accomplish this with our unified security management™ (usm) anywhere platform.\\xa0of course, the effectiveness of any security solution is largely determined by the threat intelligence underpinning it. in any environment, we need to identify the common tactics, techniques, and procedures (ttps) adversaries are using in their attacks. below, we provide an overview of the latest threat intelligence from alien labs™ for google cloud platform (gcp), which helps security practitioners to discover issues in their cloud workloads and detect adversaries exploiting attack vectors commonly seen in cloud environments.this summer, at&t cybersecurity launched the usm anywhere™ integration with gcp. through the usm anywhere alien app for gcp, usm can now consume all logging information managed by the stackdriver utility in a configurable and intuitive way.google cloud platform logs are provided through three major channels:in usm, these channels are processed by different plugins, which extract pieces of intelligence and map them to variables that are easy to steer into orchestration rules. the correlation engine allows for the combination of detections from different channels into a single orchestration rule, scaling gcp security to a new level.to prevent an intrusion from being recorded or triggering a notification, adversaries may try to disable audit logging once they get the necessary permissions. to protect against that, the product has out of the box correlation rules to generate an alert if any of the logging features is disabled.access management control is possibly the most security critical feature to manage properly in a cloud environment. gcp accounts are linked to google or google apps accounts, which means that attackers must find a way to access valid credentials before attempting to compromise cloud resources.users of the gcloud cli utility need to pay special attention to credentials.db and access_tokens.db. these database files are stored in c:\\\\users\\\\{user}\\\\appdata\\\\roaming\\\\gcloud for windows machines and ~/.config/gcloud/ in unix systems along with the legacy_credentials directory. any user who accesses these files will be able to impersonate the google account from another machine.an interesting utility that helps to look for stored credentials in windows machines is sharpcloud. this tool digs into the filesystem to find stored gcp, aws, and azure credentials by inspecting the default installation directories. alien labs threat intelligence is directly integrated and continuously updated in usm provides the logic to alert on adversaries attempting to use this tool.to help\\xa0 protect against credential phishing, multi-factor authentication methods, like security keys or backup codes, can serve as a final protection layer.however, in some scenarios, adversaries can take control of a machine with legitimate access to the cloud or have their own valid account. in addition, many organizations continue to struggle with managing the accidental exposure of api keys or service account credentials, which sometimes can be found hardcoded in web applications or committed to public repositories.for those cases, usm can help to identify and alert on anomalous user behaviors.usually, credentials thieves won’t steal and abuse the credentials right away, but will store and sell them to others (a growing market of stolen google compute credentials is arising in the dark market).as analyzed in our recent blog about cryptomining attacks detected on aws, attacks targeting cloud environments are focusing on compute resources consumption and identity management manipulation. for instance, it is likely that adversaries accessing the cloud environment will try to create alternative accounts (preventing loss of access if the credentials they stole get revoked), deleting the user’s original accounts or assigning elevated privileges for themselves.usm detects resource hijacking activity via audit logging when large volumes of assets are manipulated, new instances are launched in unusual regions, or the limits are reached:containers are another preferred target when it comes to hijack cloud resources. in late 2018, a newly discovered vulnerability impacting kubelet api triggered an uptick of activity exploiting\\xa0 exposed kube-apiserver services.kubelet, the primary agent that rules kube-nodes, does not prevent unauthenticated access to the endpoint by default. this means if the network configuration is not properly protected, it can lead to sensitive information exposure and arbitrary code execution. more importantly, adversaries can try to steal google’s service account access tokens, stored at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/tokenone way to read these files would be an anonymous ‘exec’ request. tools like the kubelet-anon-rce script helps to automate unauthenticated access.usm can help prevent this scenario by alerting on unsecure kubelet api configurations or multiple rejected unauthenticated access attempts.when it comes to protecting data, security practitioners should also be monitoring storage security. access control to gcs buckets is managed by special policies called “bucket policies,” which grant special permissions to individual users in a bucket, regardless of their role in the project (if any).using these policies, it’s possible to make data public. contrary to regular project policies, bucket policies allow for the addition of public users - allusers and allauthenticatedusers - to a project role. this can result in a privilege escalation scenario whereby the public user is added to a role with write permissions — for example, the storage legacy bucket role.if a bucket is misconfigured, adversaries can modify their own role to get admin permissions and gain control of the data. a few months ago, i tried a rhino security labs tool called gcpbucketbrute. this script can help a user find a “public” misconfigured bucket with word-based enumeration, and it can automate the privilege escalation process.therefore, it’s vitally important to monitor public user activity in gcp for stored data. within usm, we created rules to help protect against storage misconfigurations, such as having the public user added to a privileged group.it is also possible to detect gcpbucketbrute in the enumeration process, when the tool generates multiple requests to various endpoints with similar names. alerts triggered for this in usm will show the specific endpoints that were reached and the source of the requests, helping to pinpoint unprotected resources.as organizations continue to migrate workloads to the cloud, alien labs will focus on expanding the usm security analytics capabilities for cloud platforms, including amazon aws, azure, and gcp. with the release of the usm alienapp for gcp, we included a set of new correlation rules covering critical gcp security misconfigurations and use cases.most cloud threat scenarios involve identity and account manipulation, credentials theft, and storage access. other cloud features like containerization are also protected with the recent release of correlation rules for kubernetes, compatible to both gcp, gke and aws eks.this new set of cloud-based correlation rules expands our coverage, which already includes aws cloudtrail and guardduty, box™, okta, microsoft® azure security center and office365, among others.(this represents the correlation rules as of the date of this blog. we are continuously updating our gcp rule set.

            "{'titel': 'slack phishing attacks using webhooks', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsslack is a cloud-based messaging platform that is commonly used in workplace communications. it is feature-rich, offering additional functionality such as video calling and screen sharing in addition to a marketplace containing thousands of third-party applications and add-ons.slack incoming webhooks allow you to post messages from your applications to slack. by specifying a unique url, your message body, and a destination channel, you can send a message to any webhook that you know the url for in any workspace, regardless of membership. webhooks take the format of https://hooks.slack.com/services/t00000000/b00000000/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.generally, slack webhooks are considered a low risk integration due to the following assumptions:a deeper dive into webhooks shows that this is not entirely accurate.first, a channel override allows you to override the previously specified webhook target channel by adding the “channel” key to your json payload. if you gain access to a webhook for one channel, you can use it in others. considering sending to #general, #engineering, and other default or common channels to target a wider audience.in some cases, this can also override channel posting permissions (such as admin-only posting).slack documentation suggests that allowed target channels are based on the original creator of the webhook: “posting_to_general_channel_denied is thrown when an incoming webhook attempts to post to the \"#general\" channel for a workspace where posting to that channel is 1) restricted and 2) the creator of the same incoming webhook is not authorized to post there. you\\'ll receive this error with a http 403.” so if you can find a webhook created by an admin - congrats, you can post to admin channels!a quick search on github shows 130,989 public code results containing slack webhook urls, with a majority containing the full unique webhook value.the last assumption is true - webhooks can only accept data. that’s where we get creative.the process itself is fairly simple:as mentioned earlier, github is a good start for scraping publicly committed webhook data.first, create an app. you will also need a web server to handle the oauth flow.slack apps don’t require oauth, but in this case we will be using the slack api to access data in workspaces where the malicious app is installed. when the user attempts to install the application, they must approve the requested oauth scopes. their approval is sent to the oauth client, which retrieves an access token from the authorization server. this access token may be used to retrieve data using the specified service scopes until authorization is revoked. read more about using oauth 2.0 here.you will also need to set your oauth scope(s) to whatever data you want to exfiltrate from slack. in my case, i chose files:read in order to access files on the victim\\'s workspace.your redirect url must be set to the oauth client url.the following code snippet can be used to handle the oauth 2.0 handshake using python and flask.the following payload will send a message to the #general channel associated with the unique webhook url. in this scenario, we’re claiming that the webhook configuration needs to be updated.payload:message:the link points to https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?scope=files:read&client_id=834500968371.846020497941, which is actually the shareable url for my malicious slack app.upon clicking, the user will be directed to install “webhook configuration”.at no point is it clear that the victim has interacted with any domain except for slack.com.after exchanging the temporary authorization code for the access token, you will receive a response from slack containing the access token in addition to some other data, including identifiers for the user, team, and enterprise they are part of.distribution statistics can also be tracked from your app’s distribution page at https://api.slack.com/apps/.once you receive the user’s access token, you are free to access data on their behalf. note that slack has mostly moved to using perspectival scopes, i.e. user tokens or bot tokens that give access within the context of that entity. what you can access depends on the requester access and the scopes that your app initially requested. in my example, files:read was used.the above request allows us to list all files that the user has access to, and subsequently download each of them using the access token and the private url returned by the files.list method.the example in this post shows a simple phishing and data exfiltration flow. in theory, this could also be used for propagation of attacks across users and workspaces.the chat.postmessage method allows you to send messages via channel or direct message. with the chat:write:user permission, messages can be sent as_user using the context of the user token. compromising one member of your workspace would allow more targeted or convincing malicious messages to be sent to channels they are part of or directly to their peers, similar to the high-profile gsuite phishing attack in 2018 which was also covered by us in a previous blog post.users of shared channels can direct message users participating in the shared channels across workspaces. targeting those users would allow for compromise across multiple workspaces.application whitelistingadministrators have the option to manage their users’ slack applications. in less sensitive workspaces, this may involve only allowing apps from the app directory. applications added to the directory are required to go through slack’s own app security review process prior to approval.more sensitive environments may call for application whitelisting/application approval, requiring an administrator to review and approve applications before installation. this option is strongly recommended for companies looking to comply with ccpa, gdpr, and other regulations that require tracking of sharing of personal data with third parties.detection of suspicious oauth applicationsif whitelisting is not an option or you’d like an extra layer of defense, you may be interested in detecting suspicious slack oauth applications that users are adding to your workspace. by ingesting slack audit log data into a security analytics platform such as usm anywhere, one can alert on these suspicious actions.for example, some items of interest might include:see more on the event actions that can be monitored in slack’s official documentation.some mitigations could only be implemented by slack.implement least privilege for incoming webhookswebhooks should default to only working in the defined channel. multi-channel webhooks/overrides should be a separate application or opt-in setting. since the override feature is nested under a “setup instructions” pane that requires user interaction to display, many users are not aware of it. webhooks should not be able to post to announcement-only/admin-only channels unless that channel is explicitly defined in the webhook configuration.improved awareness of secrets handlingnone of the text on the incoming webhook configuration page asserts the importance of secure storage of the webhook url. this issue paired with the hidden “features” of incoming webhooks may lead to users assuming low-to-no risk associated with webhooks, as is supported by the frequency of webhooks publicly committed.application verificationapps that have not been reviewed by slack and are not local to the workspace should have limited functionality or require further verification. consider a process similar to the google oauth verification process, where unverified apps using high-risk scopes require additional developer identity verification and/or are capped to a certain number of users to avoid widespread abuse.webhooks are credential tools that provide access to posting functionality within a workspace.\\xa0though data cannot be exposed through webhooks on slack, we do recommend that workspace owners or admins invalidate publicly exposed webhook urls and generate new ones. to help slack admins with that diligence, we\\xa0proactively scrape github for publicly exposed webhooks and invalidate them. webhooks are safe as long as they remain secret since the webhook url itself is unguessable.\\xa0we also recommend workspace owners and admins use\\xa0these best practices\\xa0for storing credentials safely and that they review\\xa0this guide\\xa0to sending messages using incoming webhooks.we also provide additional features to support the proper oversight of app installation and usage within workspaces, which help workspace owners and admins protect their workspaces. we allow teams to require admin approvals on all apps, and recommend they establish and follow basic security diligence procedures before permitting apps to be added into a workspace. our security recommendations for approving apps can be found\\xa0here.tags: phishing, slack, webhooksinsights reportat&t cybersecurity

            "{'titel': 'security monitoring for managed cloud kubernetes', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsphoto by\\xa0chuttersnap\\xa0on\\xa0unsplashkubernetes (k8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. it has recently seen rapid adoption across enterprise environments.many environments rely on managed kubernetes services such as google kubernetes engine (gke) and amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) to take advantage of the benefits of both containerization and the cloud. google cloud platform, for example, offers advanced cluster management features such as automatic upgrades, load balancing, and stackdriver logging. amazon web services (aws) provides kubernetes(r) role based access control (rbac) integration with aws iam authenticator and logging via cloudtrail and cloudwatch.however, adoption of these cloud-managed services can introduce new challenges to your monitoring and detection capabilities, such as:the purpose of this post and associated release is to help fill in the detection gaps between kubernetes, eks, and gke, and provide normalized detection strategies that include multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments.with their advanced features, cloud-managed services add potential and new attack vectors as well as room for error or confusion.kubernetes itself is highly complex; trail of bits recently published a security assessment of the kubernetes platform. the intent of the audit was to identify and document existing risks and vulnerabilities of the platform, ultimately providing recommendations to improve its security posture.the assessment team found configuration and deployment of kubernetes to be non-trivial, with certain components having “confusing default settings, missing operational controls, and implicitly defined security controls”. this presents a need to understand the vulnerabilities and limitations of the platform itself, in addition to passing a high technical barrier of entry.each managed cloud service may remediate these issues differently (or not at all). according to google, “the report also calls out kubernetes’ default settings. in gke, we’ve been actively changing these over time, including turning off abac and basic authentication by default, to make sure new clusters you create are more secure.”\\xa0 abac is attribute-based access control.insecure defaults may have inconsistent fixes between managed platforms, and new protections may not apply to earlier versions. a well-intentioned administrator may also re-enable insecure settings to restore previous functionality or compatibility.because of this, our new detections are focused not only on potential attacks but on environmental awareness with an emphasis on multi-cloud support.managed services such as amazon elastic kubernetes service (eks) and google kubernetes engine (gke) use a shared responsibility model which describe the role of security of the cloud and security in the cloud (see: the gke shared responsibility model versus eks).the good news is that this model clearly defines things that aren’t your responsibility - like the underlying infrastructure, the etcd database, and control plane nodes. the bad news is that you also need to understand what you are responsible for in order to implement the proper security monitoring and controls, and this includes platform-specific implementations such as defining and protecting your security groups or iam roles.api server flags, security control defaults, and the kubernetes patch version may also be considered in their purview for new systems, while any modifications to that or continued use of legacy systems become yours. through correlation rules you are able to better track these security regressions.logs are the foundation of security monitoring and the key to understanding who is doing what on your systems. usm anywhere supports log collection for aws, gcp, and azure, which significantly expedites the collection and normalization of log data.in addition to the kubernetes control plane logs, you should also remember to monitor the associated api logs for the cloud services such as api calls to eks or gke.for cloud-managed kubernetes logging you’ll need to understand which logs you need, where to send them, and any limitations that may influence your decisions. for example, gke container logs are removed when their host pod is removed, if the log storage disk runs out of space, or when logs are periodically rotated. once exported to an external source such as stackdriver though, retention is only affected by the policy (if any) set on that platform and the events can be easily ingested into the siem.see the following tips to maximize your log coverage:gkekubernetes audit logging is integrated with cloud audit logs and stackdriver logging.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0-\\xa0admin activity log - contains api calls for administrative, state-changing actions on resources;

            "{'titel': 'why should you use correlation rules on top of traditional signatures', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthe at&t cybersecurity alien labs team is in charge of writing correlation rules and releasing threat intelligence updates on a day-to-day basis. when researchers in the team find new malware families or threats, we always try to find the best approach to keep our customers protected. in this blog, we will look into some of the differences between signatures and correlation rules.signatures are the values (sequence of bytes, string patterns, etc.) that security products use to detect known malicious behavior. for example: snort/suricata rules, antivirus signatures and yara rules.on the other hand, correlation is the processing of the event stream in order to identify important events or patterns of events within large volumes of data. the logic to identify these events is defined in a correlation rule.to clearly see the advantages of using these correlation rules and how they usually complement traditional rules, we will look at some examples like baldr stealer, ursnif banking trojan and alpc 0-day vulnerability and how we find the best approach.example 1: malware versioningin this first example, we will cover how a malware family can evolve with time and how the behavior and configuration can change between versions. in those cases, signatures can lose their detection criteria and stop triggering alerts. a great example of this is the baldr malware that has been present since january 2019 and has presented major modifications through different versions.sophos has written a great report called baldr vs the world where you can find a lot of information about this malware and also compare the differences of version 2.x with version 3. if we analyze some of the samples to see the network connections performed to command and control server, we can easily observe the differences introduced in every version release.baldr version 1.x.xthe first discovered version of baldr was using a simple http post request with victim’s information contained in the uri. as you can see, it makes so easy to write a nids signature to detect the pattern within the network packets.baldr version 2.xin the second version, or at least in version 2.2 and above, they changed the previous request and now the communication with command and control is encrypted with a xor key. here we can see the initial beacon where xor key is always sent to the victim along with the version separated by “;” delimiter, more difficult to detect with signatures but still possible.baldr version 3.xfinally in the third version, the communication method is pretty similar to the one used in the second version and they are still using a xor key. however, they changed the delimiter by “~;~” and now they are also sending some configuration settings. these changes force us to create a new signature.knowing that, it is clear that network signatures written for version 1.x.x won’t work with versions 2.x and 3.x, the same thing happens with signatures for 2.x and 3.x. this scenario makes us think that if there were a new version, it would not be detected with the existing signatures and we will need to keep researching and creating new signatures whenever a new version of the malware is released.instead of that, we could try to observe all the actions performed by malware from the initial attack vector to the final command and control communication and correlate the events to create a detection. based on the research made into the malware family, attackers used two different methods to distribute and infect victims: crafted ace files, which exploit the winrar cve-2018-20250 vulnerability and also rtf documents targeting microsoft office products with cve-2018-0802 vulnerability.correlation rules could have helped us detect those attacks from the initial access phase and from the actions performed in victim’s systems. here is a list of possible pseudo-correlation rules:example 2: malware with many indicatorssometimes a malware family is difficult to detect because it doesn’t use http for beaconing, the communication is hidden or any other circumstances. a common approach when you can’t detect the communication is to keep track of all the malicious infrastructure to keep updating the indicators, making it very time consuming and inefficient. this is the case of ursnif malware, a banking trojan that tries to steal user information such as account credentials. if we take a look at the existing signatures for this malware, we will find a large amount of nids signatures and yara rules that tries to detect some of the indicators of compromise present in the samples.on the other hand, correlation rules can be used to detect malicious patterns in the behavior and benefit from the advantages discussed above. the following correlation rules could detect the ursnif malware without the need to update or create new signatures whenever new indicators are present.example 3: new malware or attack with no existing signaturesanother interesting scenario to demonstrate the advantages of correlation rules is when a new malware or attack begins to appear and there is no signature present to detect it. in those cases, an existing correlation rule, looking for suspicious behaviors that normally don’t happen in a system, could detect it.to explain this example we will talk about the alpc 0-day vulnerability affecting microsoft windows systems. this vulnerability was publicly released without any patch and many systems were vulnerable to it. since it was a local privilege escalation (lpe) and only a proof of concept (poc) was available, network and endpoint signatures were nonexistent and not enough to detect a possible exploitation. by doing quick research about the method used to perform the privilege escalation, the list of correlation rules that detects the threat is:we have talked about the benefits and advantages that correlation rules provide when we want to create detection methods. however, there are also some important things to take into consideration: there are no silver bullets in security, and it is better to be conservative and complement different methods and technologies to improve your detection capabilities. use regular signatures and iocs whenever you can, as they are fast to write and deploy, and have very high confidence.some of the cons of using correlations rules are:tags: alien labs, ids signatures, correlation

            "{'titel': 'alien labs 2019 analysis of threat groups molerats and apt c 37', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsin 2019, several industry analyst reports confused the threat groups molerats and apt-c-37 due to their similarity, and this has led to some confusion and inaccuracy of attribution.for example, both groups target the middle east and north africa region (with a special emphasis on palestine territories). and, they both approach victims through the use of phishing emails that contain decoy documents (mostly in arabic) and contain themes concerning the political situation in the area.to improve understanding of the differences and similarities of the two groups (as well as the links between them), we at alien labs™ are providing an analysis of their 2019 activity.a recent spear-phishing document from moleratsapt-c-37, also known as pat-bear or the syrian electronic army (sea), was first seen in october 2015 targeting members of a terrorist organization. since 2015, however, apt-c-37 has broadened their objectives to include government agencies, armed forces leadership, media organizations, political activists, and diplomats. the group mostly targets victims in western countries, with the intent of defacing their websites and social accounts while leaving a public footprint after hacking one of their victims.in previous attacks, apt-c-37 targeted windows and android systems, utilizing popular commercial remote access trojans (rats) such as droidjack, spynote, njrat, sslove, and h-worm.molerats has been present in the cybercriminal landscape since 2012. in an analysis released by the kaspersky’s great (global research & analysis team) earlier this year on the gaza hacker team and their various subgroups, kaspersky concluded that molerats is gaza cybergang “group1.” the report also concluded that molerats (i.e. cybergang group 1) operates with a lower level of sophistication than other groups within the gaza hacker team. in addition, a 2016 article in security week reported that one of molerats campaigns (october 2016) heavily used popular rats like njrat and h-worm (aka houdini).october 2019: in molerats’ october operation, the attack was distributed as a phishing campaign in the middle east. emails included a microsoft word file attachment with the title “daily report on the most important palestinian developments for the day 9-9-2019.doc” — content that spoke to the political situation in palestine. when a victim opened the attachment, the malware performed the following:diagram of molerats october 2019 campaignseptember-october 2019: in molerat’s september campaign, the malware propagated through an executable with a fake pdf file. with the names “the case of muath ismail haniyeh.pdf.exe” and “interface.pdf.exe,” the executables are both signed under the name “foxitreader.”when a victim opened the attachment, the malware performed the following:diagram of molerats\\xa0september – october 2019 campaignaugust 2019: in august, molerats ran another campaign, however we did not detect the use of phishing. instead, alien labs identified a sample communicating with a new domain that used the same c&c pattern detected by an ids signature. you can find details and more on the open threat exchange (otx). the domain, which has been up since 2017, has two malicious files associated with it:january 2019: in january, molerats switched its tactics back to phishing with word documents that concealed a malicious vbscript. the vbs contained an encoded version of the malware, which was scheduled and executed after decryption. the malicious file corresponded to a version of the fraudrop trojan, packed with enigma as previously seen in other molerats’ samples, and it used the simple and fast multimedia library (smfl), which is commonly used for game development.diagram of molerats\\xa0january 2019 campaignnovember 2019: in november, alien labs discovered a new molerats sample. in this case, the group recycled the domain used in their january attack for c&c. in this campaign, an executable with an arabic name that translates to “winter government by names,” extracted and executed a modified version of the fraudrop trojan. molerats had attempted to hide the packer they were using and they modified the filename, however the c&c and beacon they used were the same and they were using the smf library for development.diagram of molerats november 2019 campaign\\xa0\\xa0apt-c-37\\xa0moleratsnames\\xa0targetstimelines\\xa0since october

three attacks below have been attributed to apt-c-37 and molerats, however it’s our opinion at alien labs that they don’t share the clear patterns of molerats or apt-c-37 we’ve seen prior to this blog.november 2019 (palestinian election): attributed on twitter by rising enterprise security to apt-c-37this campaign tried to utilize the palestinian elections as a theme for their phishing emails, and the target appeared to be the palestinian government. we observed the use of phishing emails in the campaign with fake documents themed after the elections that contained at least two different malicious files. the file names are (translated here):both files used a microsoft word icon in attempt to make the victims run the malicious executable. when executed it performed the following.diagram of november 2019 attributed on twitter to apt-c-37august 2019: attributed on twitter to apt-c-37this attack, attributed to apt-c-37 on twitter, is very similar to the november 2019 attack described above, however it did not use the palestinian elections to lure victims. this time, the threat group used another .exe which included a decoy word document titled “a new scandal for a hamas leader”. the execution was very similar to the november 2019 campaign, however this time the camouflaged lnk file was “history.lnk” and it installed a version of houdini rat.diagram of august 2019 campaign attributed on twitter to apt-c-37april 2019: attributed on twitter to apt-c-37in april 2019, security researchers on twitter observed another phishing email with an attached executable. when executed, the malware opened a document talking about the palestinian ministers to keep the victim entertained while it installed a lnk file “msofficee.lnk,” which is very close to the real “msoffice.lnk.” the file allowed the houdini rat to execute and gain persistence on the targeted machine.diagram of april 2019 campaign attributed on twitter to apt-c-37the three attacks above have the following similar characteristics:the above-mentioned target and the delivery methods suggest these attacks are being launched by molerats (note: the houdini rat is very popular in the middle east and cannot be used for attribution). however, in the opinion of alien labs, the other attack patterns make it hard for us to tie these attacks to molerats or apt-c-37, as they do not have a clear pattern that aligns to the samples previously associated with molerats or apt-c-37. in light of this, alien labs currently buckets these three attacks under an unattributed classification.yes, indeed, we have seen similar patterns between molerats and apt-c-37 in 2019. however, molerats has shown to be a more active group (even beyond 2019), with a more advanced tradecraft and methods that are more difficult to defend against due to the use of https, high rotation of malware, or even ip filtering to specific geolocations. therefore, we do not have a high level of confidence that the latest samples belong to any of these two groups or have a relationship at this time. having said this, we offer a caveat: of the samples we analyzed, we left three unattributed for the moment. through future analysis, we may find that these do fall under either molerats or apt-c-37. if that happens, we’ll keep you updated in otx.tags: malware, malware research, alien labs, molerats,

            "{'titel': 'att alien labs analysis of an active cryptomining worm', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labsthis blog post provides an overview of the at&t alien labs™ technical analysis of the common malicious implants used by threat actors targeting vulnerable exim, confluence, and weblogic servers. upon exploitation, malicious implants are deployed on the compromised machine. while most of the attacks described below are historical, we at alien labs are continuing to see new attacks, which can be further researched on the alien labs open threat exchange™ (otx).the main goal of these malicious implants thus far has been mining monero crypto-currency. below, we have included a diagram of a typical attack vector for this cryptomining worm.for our research, we analyzed the following sample (you can also see related pulses on this in otx): f00258815853f767d70897db7263f740b161c39ee50c46c26ab247afb824459a.first, the adversaries attempt exploitation. when they are successful and code execution is achieved, they then download and execute a deployment bash script from the command and control (c&c) server. this script’s main function is to act as a loader for the malicious payload. the script also has worming capabilities to infect other hosts and maintain persistence.the script uses a basic obfuscation mechanism where $_ variables are declared with string portions. these variables are then combined with others to form commands or sensible strings.we can deobfuscate it easily by using a regex.the malware distribution server is reversed and declared by the entropy variable. this seems constant amongst all the analyzed samples.the first thing the script does is check to see if the machine is already infected. if so, it kills the mining processes:it then tries to infect other machines via ssh (by reading known_hosts file and trying to connect to known hosts). this is the worming component. if a connection is successfully established, the deployment script will be executed on the remote machine:the script then downloads two things dubbed 1) seasame and 2) omelette — perhaps because omelette comes from the $egg.omelette is an elf binary and seasame is the bash deployment script that we are analyzing. one reason the script downloads again is the download can act as an update mechanism. the hashes for downloaded executables are listed below:716042b8e32cfb364b04c4e068a37a8e60c928e4fd32c894282c5d658c138684 omelettef00258815853f767d70897db7263f740b161c39ee50c46c26ab247afb824459a seasamethe download executes via wget, curl, python2 / 3 or php — in that order, depending on which one is supported in the infected system.possible eggs (implants) are shown by the installation script:the script provides for multiple implants to account for different system architectures. as of today, the supported architectures are x86, x86-64 and aarch64. for each architecture, the script provides two binaries: one statically linked and another one dynamically linked.rather than trying to select the system architecture and then download the corresponding implant, the malware authors have opted to download implants in a loop and then break the loop when the first implant sticks.persistency is achieved by adding the seasame script to a cron job. this cron job also acts as a kill prevention mechanism for the malicious payload, as it is executed every 5 minutes.if systemd is detected, a service is also created with the “cloud-agent” namenew_dog spawns a new bot and new_killbot kills all instances.characteristically it copies the bash binary to another one with a random name. it also copies curl to curlak and wget to wgetak.as reported in our otx analysis, the sample is trying to spread to other hosts by checking the known_host’s file. this is gathered from the “connects to hosts declared in the known_hosts file (usually for worm propagation)” signature found in the “dynamic analysis” tab.in the “network analysis” tab we can also observe that the sample is downloading an elf file and then a cryptocurrency miner checks in. this is what led us to believe the downloaded payload is a cryptocurrency miner.we analyzed the sample e2964214fdbfb51d5b33944cc9ca05821518a4bad01f750cee8f0d00f68a6176the sample we analyzed is one of the implants obtained directly from a c&c observed in one of the deployment scripts. particularly, this sample was obtained from http://51.15.56[.]161:162/43d.jpg.upon initial inspection the file is an elf 32-bit lsb executable for the intel 80386 architecture. although the binary is stripped, we have access to function names as the binary was coded in c++. strings are also unobfuscated, for the most part.by simple observation of the strings, it is not hard to see that this binary is a modified version of the open-source xmrig (https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) monero miner. the most important modification is in the configuration loader class for the xmrig client, which has been modified to load an obfuscated, hard-coded configuration. the rather simple obfuscation lies in the string reverse operation and hex encoding:judging by the network communications, the modified xmrig client is mining through a xmrig-proxy server, so the wallet and the mining poll addresses are not directly accessible without access to the proxy server. below is a screenshot from the pcap obtained after executing the malicious implant in our sandbox:through additional research on otx, alien labs determined that we are dealing with a cryptocurrency miner. first, we can observe the “cryptocurrency miner checkin” rule being triggered in the “network analysis” tab. we can also observe that the sample is using hard-coded ip addresses rather than domain names as the “communicates with host for which no dns query was performed” signature is triggered in the “dynamic analysis” tab.the extraction of the c&c / proxy addresses can be automated through the use of a yara rule to match the configuration loader and a python script to de-reference the virtual address. as the malicious actors are using a proxy server, we will not be able to extract the wallet address nor the mining pool through this method. also, it is important to note that this method will not work in packed binaries.executing such a script through the gathered 100+ samples during the hunting phase yields the following unique command & control addresses:the yara rule used for this task can be found in the “indicators of compromise” section below.we first discovered indicators of compromise from this campaign in early june 2019, and ever since we have been tracking the activity of this threat actor. at the time of writing this report, the threat actor is still active and their infrastructure is still up.while not being a very big campaign, this individual or group has managed to go under the radar for some months, without drawing much attention.it is hard to estimate how much income this campaign has reported to the threat actor, as the miner is configured to mine through a proxy, and thus conceals the receiving wallet address.in otx and usm we have created multiple detection rules to help detect and block this threat.given the uniqueness of this script we can do a vt retrohunt to get similar scripts with the following yara rule:we can do a yara rule for the modifications found in the xmrig client as well:observed unique c&c uris:for more indicators of compromise, please see the otx pulse.tags: malware research, malware hunting, yara, bash, exim, python, confluence, weblogic,

which helps security practitioners to discover issues in their cloud workloads and detect adversaries exploiting attack vectors commonly seen in cloud environments.this summer, at&t cybersecurity launched the usm anywhere™ integration with gcp. through the usm anywhere alien app for gcp, usm can now consume all logging information managed by the stackdriver utility in a configurable and intuitive way.google cloud platform logs are provided through three major channels:in usm, these channels are processed by different plugins, which extract pieces of intelligence and map them to variables that are easy to steer into orchestration rules. the correlation engine allows for the combination of detections from different channels into a single orchestration rule, scaling gcp security to a new level.to prevent an intrusion from being recorded or triggering a notification, adversaries may try to disable audit logging once they get the necessary permissions. to protect against that, the product has out of the box correlation rules to generate an alert if any of the logging features is disabled.access management control is possibly the most security critical feature to manage properly in a cloud environment. gcp accounts are linked to google or google apps accounts, which means that attackers must find a way to access valid credentials before attempting to compromise cloud resources.users of the gcloud cli utility need to pay special attention to credentials.db and access_tokens.db. these database files are stored in c:\\\\users\\\\{user}\\\\appdata\\\\roaming\\\\gcloud for windows machines and ~/.config/gcloud/ in unix systems along with the legacy_credentials directory. any user who accesses these files will be able to impersonate the google account from another machine.an interesting utility that helps to look for stored credentials in windows machines is sharpcloud. this tool digs into the filesystem to find stored gcp, aws, and azure credentials by inspecting the default installation directories. alien labs threat intelligence is directly integrated and continuously updated in usm provides the logic to alert on adversaries attempting to use this tool.to help\\xa0 protect against credential phishing, multi-factor authentication methods, like security keys or backup codes, can serve as a final protection layer.however, in some scenarios, adversaries can take control of a machine with legitimate access to the cloud or have their own valid account. in addition, many organizations continue to struggle with managing the accidental exposure of api keys or service account credentials, which sometimes can be found hardcoded in web applications or committed to public repositories.for those cases, usm can help to identify and alert on anomalous user behaviors.usually, credentials thieves won’t steal and abuse the credentials right away, but will store and sell them to others (a growing market of stolen google compute credentials is arising in the dark market).as analyzed in our recent blog about cryptomining attacks detected on aws, attacks targeting cloud environments are focusing on compute resources consumption and identity management manipulation. for instance, it is likely that adversaries accessing the cloud environment will try to create alternative accounts (preventing loss of access if the credentials they stole get revoked), deleting the user’s original accounts or assigning elevated privileges for themselves.usm detects resource hijacking activity via audit logging when large volumes of assets are manipulated, new instances are launched in unusual regions, or the limits are reached:containers are another preferred target when it comes to hijack cloud resources. in late 2018, a newly discovered vulnerability impacting kubelet api triggered an uptick of activity exploiting\\xa0 exposed kube-apiserver services.kubelet, the primary agent that rules kube-nodes, does not prevent unauthenticated access to the endpoint by default. this means if the network configuration is not properly protected, it can lead to sensitive information exposure and arbitrary code execution. more importantly, adversaries can try to steal google’s service account access tokens, stored at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/tokenone way to read these files would be an anonymous ‘exec’ request. tools like the kubelet-anon-rce script helps to automate unauthenticated access.usm can help prevent this scenario by alerting on unsecure kubelet api configurations or multiple rejected unauthenticated access attempts.when it comes to protecting data, security practitioners should also be monitoring storage security. access control to gcs buckets is managed by special policies called “bucket policies,” which grant special permissions to individual users in a bucket, regardless of their role in the project (if any).using these policies, it’s possible to make data public. contrary to regular project policies, bucket policies allow for the addition of public users - allusers and allauthenticatedusers - to a project role. this can result in a privilege escalation scenario whereby the public user is added to a role with write permissions — for example, the storage legacy bucket role.if a bucket is misconfigured, adversaries can modify their own role to get admin permissions and gain control of the data. a few months ago, i tried a rhino security labs tool called gcpbucketbrute. this script can help a user find a “public” misconfigured bucket with word-based enumeration, and it can automate the privilege escalation process.therefore, it’s vitally important to monitor public user activity in gcp for stored data. within usm, we created rules to help protect against storage misconfigurations, such as having the public user added to a privileged group.it is also possible to detect gcpbucketbrute in the enumeration process, when the tool generates multiple requests to various endpoints with similar names. alerts triggered for this in usm will show the specific endpoints that were reached and the source of the requests, helping to pinpoint unprotected resources.as organizations continue to migrate workloads to the cloud, alien labs will focus on expanding the usm security analytics capabilities for cloud platforms, including amazon aws, azure, and gcp. with the release of the usm alienapp for gcp, we included a set of new correlation rules covering critical gcp security misconfigurations and use cases.most cloud threat scenarios involve identity and account manipulation, credentials theft, and storage access. other cloud features like containerization are also protected with the recent release of correlation rules for kubernetes, compatible to both gcp, gke and aws eks.this new set of cloud-based correlation rules expands our coverage, which already includes aws cloudtrail and guardduty, box™, okta, microsoft® azure security center and office365, among others.(this represents the correlation rules as of the date of this blog. we are continuously updating our gcp rule set.

            "{'titel': 'the great cannon has been deployed again', 'Explanation': 'powered byat&t alien labssummarythe great cannon is a distributed denial of service tool (“ddos”) that operates by injecting malicious javascript into pages served from behind the great firewall. these scripts, potentially served to millions of users across the internet, hijack the users’ connections to make multiple requests against the targeted site. these requests consume all the resources of the targeted site, making it unavailable:figure 1: simplified diagram of how the great cannon operatesthe great cannon was the subject of intense research after it was used to disrupt access to the website github.com in 2015. little has been seen of the great cannon since 2015. however, we’ve recently observed new attacks, which are detailed below.most recent attacks against lihkgthe great cannon is currently attempting to take the website lihkg offline. lihkg has been used to organize protests in hong kong. using a simple script that uses data from urlscan.io, we identified new attacks likely starting monday november 25th, 2019.websites are indirectly serving a malicious javascript file from either:normally these urls serve standard analytics tracking scripts. however, for a certain percentage of requests, the great cannon swaps these on the fly with malicious code:\\xa0figure 2: malicious code served from the great cannonthe code attempts to repeatedly request the following resources, in order to overwhelm websites and prevent them from being accessible:these may seem like an odd selection of websites and memes to target, however these meme images appear on the lihkg forums so the traffic is likely intended to blend in with normal traffic. the urls are appended to the lihkg image proxy url (eg;\\xa0https://na.cx/i/6hxp6x9.gif\\xa0becomes\\xa0\\xa0https://i.lih.kg/540/https://na.cx/i/6hxp6x9.gif?t=6009966493) which causes lihkg to perform the bandwidth and computationally expensive task of taking a remote image, changing its size, then serving it to the user.impactit is unlikely these sites will be seriously impacted. partly due to lihkg sitting behind an anti-ddos service, and partly due to some bugs in the malicious javascript code that we won’t discuss here.still, it is disturbing to see an attack tool with the potential power of the great cannon used more regularly, and again causing collateral damage to us based services.mitigationsthese attacks would not be successful if the following resources were served over https instead of http:you may want to consider blocking these urls when not sent over https.timeline of historical great cannon incidentsbelow we have described previous great cannon attacks, including previous attacks against lihkg in september 2019.2015: greatfire and githubduring the 2015 attacks, ddos scripts were sent in response to requests sent to a number of domains, for both javascript and html pages served over http from behind the great firewall.\\xa0a number of distinct stages and targets were identified:figure 3: snippet of the code used in early great cannon attacks. later scripts were improved to not require external javascript libraries.figure 4: the urls targeted in the attack against github.com.figure 5: snippet of the obfuscated code. current attacks continue to use the same obfuscation.research by citizenlab identified multiple likely points where the malicious code is injected. the great cannon operated probabilistically, injecting return packets to a certain percentage of requests for javascript from certain ip addresses. as noted by commentators at the time, the same functionality could also be used to insert exploitation code to enable “man-on-the-side” attacks to compromise key targets.2017 and onward: attacks against mingjingnewsin august 2017, great cannon attacks against a chinese-language news website (mingjingnews.com) were identified by a user on stack overflow. the code in the 2017 attack is significantly re-written and is largely unchanged in the attacks seen in 2019.figure 6: an excerpt of the code to target mingjingnews.com in 2017.we have continued to see attacks against mingjingnews in the last year.2019: attacks against hong kong democracy movementon august 31, 2019, the great cannon initiated an attack against a website (lihkg.com) used by members of the hong kong democracy movement to plan protests.\\xa0the javascript code is very similar to the packer code used in the attacks against mingjingnews observed in 2017 and onward, and the code was served from at least two locations:initial versions targeted a single page on lihkg.com.figure 7: the javascript code originally targeting lihkg.com.later versions targeted multiple pages and attempted (unsuccessfully) to bypass ddos mitigations that the website owners had implemented.figure 8: the javascript code later targeting lihkg.com.detectionwe detect the great cannon serving malicious javascript with the following suricata rules from at&t alien labs and emerging threats open.additional indicators and code samples are available in the open threat exchange
